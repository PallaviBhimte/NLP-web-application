Webindex: 68415010
Company: Mini Club
Description: Good all rounders are needed to run the department. From the way the look to the way they deal with the customers, everything and anything to do with the day to day running of the store will be your responsibility. Whether you are driving sales, managing rotas, or training or inducting new starters, you will do everything to the highest standards, while developing a productive ongoing relationship with the Boots Store teams. A capable leader and people manager, you will be equally at home with hitting sales targets as you are at dealing with issues as and when they arise. Flexible, self motivated and a strong communicator, if you have a retail background, ideally in fashion and clothing, we would love to hear from you.
