Description: Care Home Manager  Stunning Location  HeantonAbout usPSP Healthcare is recognised as one of the UK's fastest growing, innovative and exciting healthcare providers for the elderly. Its MD has been identified as one of the sector's 'Top Twenty to Watch' and the company has won numerous awards including the Welsh National Dementia Care Excellence Gold Award Allcora Care Excellence Award. The Group operates nursing homes and state of the art purpose built care villages across England and Wales. In fact the Gibraltar Care Village in Monmouth has been identified as one of the UK's top three in the prestigious Pinders National Design Awards.'People Supporting People' This philosophy underpins the organisation. At the forefront, naturally, is the support that PSP provides for the elderly in its care. Each resident is viewed as an extension of the PSP family and as such afforded the respect, dedication and support that a close relative could expect. However what sets PSP apart is that this philosophy of 'people supporting people' has significance within the organisation as well. Whether its your 'buddy' on your first day inducting you on the essentials (like the location of the secret chocolate biscuit stash), the group clinical lead manager assisting you with clinical decisions, the admin team helping you arrange last minute child care when your child minder lets you down or even the maintenance team having a quick look at your car, we aim to encourage mutual support at all levels.Significantly PSP Healthcare has recognised that whilst people in the care sector provide tremendous support for those in their care, there is very little, if any, specific support available for care workers when they need support themselves. The company is therefore extremely pleased to be a founding member of the National Care Benevolent Fund which provides for those in the care sector who may fall upon hard times.
