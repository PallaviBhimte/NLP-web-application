Webindex: 68179942
Company: High Finance  Limited
Description: The UK arm of a premium global insurer based just south of Surrey is looking to hire a talented Enterprise Architect to oversee the company`s existing architecture, with more of a specific focus on the IT Infrastructure domain. The role reports into a lead Enterprise Architect and there is significant scope within the organisation to develop and push up into a more globally focused position. Experience of enterprise architecture is absolutely fundamental, and knowledge of IT Infrastructure would also prove beneficial. The candidate would also benefit from insurance experience, although this is not fundamental as my client is more concerned that the candidate be able to demonstrate experience of enterprise architecture, and an IT background. This is a fantastic opportunity to join a highly respected insurer in a role with a clear succession plan, and a complicated existing architecture.
