Description: A leading international financial services company has an exciting opportunity for a Retail Communications Manager to join their marketing team. Reporting into the Head of Marketing and managing a team of four you will oversee the planning, strategy and delivery of all mandatory and technical communications (branch and transactional material, direct mail, SEM, email) across branch and direct to consumer channels. You will take the lead on innovation and development of mandatory communications ensuring they are 'human' and 'on brand' ensuring the customer content journey is kept front of mind. Essentially you will be considered to be a point of expertise on matters of print, brand and customer communications to the immediate team and the business as a whole. To be considered for this role you need to be comfortable working under time and volume pressure with the ability to maintain accurate records through maintenance of job bags and trafficking data. You will possess the ability to manage authoritatively and demonstrate leadership potential. Marketing communications and project management skills are a must  ideally from a financial services environment though candidates from other regulated environments will also be considered. Solid knowledge of the typical print process would be an advantage with a demonstrable bias for delivery and maintaining high standards in reviewing and approving work. As we receive such a high volume of applications every day, regretfully, we are only able to respond to successful candidates who will be contacted within two working days.
