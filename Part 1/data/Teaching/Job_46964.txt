Description: Main Elements of the Duties of Foundation Learning Lead Tutor Reports to: Youth Programmes Manager Organisational Context: YMCA Southampton is part of YMCA Fairthorne Group, a fast growing charity. Our mission is to champion and add value to young lives by providing experiences that challenge, empower and develop the individual. We deliver services and programmes in youth and children’s work across **** venues throughout Southampton, Portsmouth, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. These include 2 residential activity centres, 7 nurseries, and schools as well as work in supported housing. At YMCA Southampton, we support young people from challenging backgrounds become confident and independent members of the community. This work is delivered in schools, youth clubs and through our supported housing project. Our housing work provides accommodation for **** young men and women aged **** –2****years who have support needs and who need a safe place which they can call home. Many of these young people come to us with complex needs and can exhibit very challenging behaviour. However we believe that every individual is of infinite value and that with the right support and environment, each can be helped to reach their full potential. At our Fairthorne Manor site we offer residential and outdoor education facilities, a very successful day nursery, development training courses for adults, family park and a nine hole golf course. Job Purpose The Foundation Learning Lead Tutor will work with our target client group of young people aged **** to 18 years in the development, implementation, delivery and monitoring of our Foundation Learning Programme. This includes accredited and non accreditated learning outcomes as well as work experience with local employers. The Foundation learning programme is only just being established and the lead tutor will work under the Youth Programmes Manager to ensure the programme is established correctly. The lead tutor will take the day to day responsibility for the running of the programme, supervising the tutors who support its delivery. The primary audience will be young people accommodated in our supported housing and as such it is expected that the foundation learning team will complement the wider Housing Support Team and the Schools and Youth Work Team. It is however expected that YMCA Fairthorne Group will widen the target audience for this service over time. Given the challenging nature of many of the young people we work with, it is expected that the learning outcomes will be delivered in a way which meets the learning style of the young people. This will minimise the use of the classroom and instead use different formats, including outside, activity based and 1:1 learning. It is imagined that a proportion of the delivery will take place at YMCA Fairthorne Manor, outdoor activity centre.
