Description: An opportunity has arisen at an award winning London creative agency, for a ****D designer. Our client is one of the UK's leading events and experiential agencies, based in the heart of London. They have a wonderful client list and you will instantly recognise some of the highprofile events they have worked on. You will be working on multiple projects at different work stages from conceptualisation through to build and construction. The work will involve creation of concepts; space planning; to design and visualisation of exhibitions, set designs and other ****D environments for major brands in Sports, Entertainment and Corporate sectors. You must have passion and current knowledge for experiential design and be able to perform fast and accurately under pressure working with the inhouse creative team within a fast paced studio. You have the ability to understand all areas of the clients' brand guidelines, working with the house producers and creative team to tackle some challenging client briefs. Working independently and as part of the creative team, you need to be brilliant at juggling tight deadlines and numerous briefs for multiple clients. Proficiency in Vectorworks and Sketch Up is a must and you should have strong design and sketching skills to be able to render exceptional visuals. Background in a similar experiential role in an agency would be preferable.
