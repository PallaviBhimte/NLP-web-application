Company: Resourcing Solutions Ltd
Description: Our client is a well known and most importantly, well respected, main contractor with an excellent reputation both in UK and overseas. The Marine Director is seeking a Commercial Manager to act as his No2 on a variety of marine and offshore wind projects. Working on large tenders, in marine works and offshore wind, of a minimum of 50M but more likely in the region of 100M, these are exciting projects for someone who brings the right level of experience, professionalism and enthusiasm to the role. An accomplished Commercial Manager, your experience will as a minimum be in heavy civils but more likely in marine structures such as ports and harbours or similar. Experience within the offshore wind market would be a positive advantage. Whilst we would require experience in projects to a minimum of 50M, these projects would be oneoff projects rather than framework project values so in essence oneoff projects of that magnitude. Whilst it is hoped the skills will not be required, you will also need to have experience of dispute resolution, arbitration etc. Whilst acting as the Commercial Manager, we would also expect you to have the ability and nous to set up teams for project delivery. Contract types can vary by project but would generally be LOGIC, NEC or FIDIC. Whilst this role can in essence be based anywhere in UK, you will need to be eminently flexible to travel with time required regularly in London/South East and will need some travel to Europe particularly in the early stages for liaison with other parts of the organisation.
