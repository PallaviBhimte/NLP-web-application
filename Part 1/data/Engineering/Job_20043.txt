Title: RF IC Design Engineer  South East UK
Webindex: 70756646
Company: IC Resources Ltd
Description: Semiconductor Company seeks an experienced RF IC Design Engineer with a proven track record in delivering leading products and technology with aggressive time to market requirements. Working at both the IC architecture and circuit level using deep submicron CMOS to design future generation synthesiser subsystems for multistandard radios. The role will be primarily for a circuit designer/silicon architect focussing on high performance frequency synthesis. The goal is to deliver leading edge / breakthrough performance in terms of key metrics such as phase noise, spurious performance and lock time while meeting aggressive power dissipation targets. You will have a good understanding of a range of techniques for frequency synthesis including nonlinear (constant envelope/polar) modulators, sigmadelta techniques as well as emerging digitally intensive approaches. You will work closely with system engineers on the optimisation of the system and specification of frequency synthesis blocks. You will be a strong team player able to operate as both an innovator and an implementer. You will participate in multisite developments across different time zones and cultures requiring excellent written and verbal communication skills. You will also have a strong record of innovation demonstrated through product performance, patents or other publications. This would show you to be a genuine practical innovator capable of delivering break through new technology within a commercial environment. Experience: Extensive experience of synthesiser design including overall architecture development and key circuits for fully integrated designs is essential. You will possess a good understanding of synthesiser architectures (e.g. fractionalM, integerN, multiloop designs) as well as understanding RF system requirements for cellular systems. Experience of analysis and modelling of synthesiser systems would be extremely beneficial. Experience with the Cadence Analog Design Environment is essential and experience with advanced circuit simulation tools and EM simulation tools (e.g. VerilogAMS, Matlab) is strongly desirable. Must have a minimum of 57 years of equivalent experience e.g. MSc  5 years (e.g. a minimum of **** preferably at least **** completed industrial developments) or relevant a PhD  **** relevant industrial project (>34 years) Education: BSc / MSc EE (or equivalent) minimum with relevant experience or PhD in a relevant discipline. Competitive salary ****k  ****k depending on skills and experience. Excellent benefits package including 25 days holiday, bonus scheme, pension, medical, stock options and relocation assistance if required. Contact Leon at IC Resources to apply. The closing date for this advert is Friday 27th April.
