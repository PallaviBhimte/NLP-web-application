Experience in overseas markets would be an advantage although not essential as training will be provided. You would be resident in one of their regional offices and be working closely with the partners and their clients in that region. This is not a role for someone looking to escape from the UK regulator, as my client operates on a full disclosure basis. Ideally you will be an experienced paraplanner or possibly an IFA who is looking to step back from advice and into a supporting role in a slightly warmer climate Basic up to **** (although paid locally and in Euros)  bonus  relocation package available. Interviews will take place in London or locally if not UK based
