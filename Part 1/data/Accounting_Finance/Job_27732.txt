Company: Oliver James Associates
Description: Personal lines pricing, High net worth individuals, Motor, Home, Kidnap, Ransom, Fine art. My client is a large commercial insurer that underwrites business on a variety of different platforms. They are a large, extremely stable multinational insurer. This role is based in their London office which acts as the Headquarters of their European branch. The role is to provide business support to the Chief Underwriting officer of this division. You must be comfortable supporting the senior management team as you will be working with very astute, quants driven claims and underwriting professionals who you will have to train and partner with. You will be expected to grow to become part of this management team in a short space of time. Consequently, I am seeking a commercially mature, robust, results driven actuary that has aspirations to grow into this kind of role. You will essentially be using your core actuarial skills but growing out of this sphere to incorporate business management duties. This role involves the management of at least one other actuarial analyst, though this is likely to grow over time. It also involves working closely with other actuaries in the business, both in London and their global offices. However, you will spend most of your time embedded in the personal lines team in what is largely a standalone role. This role would suit someone with strong personal lines knowledge who wants to work in an area that is very underwriter rather than statistically driven i.e. high net worth. It would suit a confident, robust character with excellent interpersonal and communication skills who wants to grown into a management role incorporating more than pure actuarial work. You will want to work closely with senior management decisionmakers, with a view to becoming part of that mechanism, all within an agile, entrpreneurial and wellrespected insurance business.
