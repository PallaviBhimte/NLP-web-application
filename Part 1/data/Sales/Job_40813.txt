Description: Sales Manager – Specialist Hydraulic Systems Circa **** per annum plus bonus. Leading the UK sales team to develop new business and expand current sectors for hydraulic products and systems in line with the company’s business plan. Proven ability to evaluate and develop markets and build long term relationships across the Uk and overseas, to operate strategically and lead your team to maximise sales and margins. In many instances the product will be engineered to a client’s needs which extends the sales process from the initial lead to full manufacturing and repeat orders, this definitely requires a consultative approach providing advice to prestigious clients and working to ensure that when full manufacturing is achieved the long term orders and spare parts requirements come your way. Experience selling into heavy vehicles, agricultural and MOD are directly relevant sectors, however there are many areas of hydraulics and it’s your sales skills and leadership ability that will make you stand out in this job . Ideally you will be based in the west midlands however this is not essential as there will be extensive travel involved and as long as you are located fairly centrally and near the motorway network that’s fine. This is a senior role with a major influence on the company’s performance, Contact Peter Starkiss with a detailed CV.
