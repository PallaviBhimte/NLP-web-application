Title: HEAD CHEF ****AAR GLOUCESTERSHIRE/WALES BORDERS ****/****K
Webindex: 69001426
Company: Gladstone Park Limited
Description: Having lived in nearby Abergavenny, we know this restaurant, with rooms built around a 17th Century Coaching Inn and its owners intimately and as such can highly recommend this position to any HEAD CHEF. They even have a copacious kitchen garden so you can even pick your own The establishment is basically a restaurant with **** rooms. However the position itself is live out. They have had ****AA Rosettes for as long as we can remember. The proprietors have sadly been let down by the newly appointed head chef and we want to find a really good replacement for them There are only **** covers plus a private dining room covered by a **** strong brigade, so the new Head Chef, will not find it difficult to maintain their long standing ****AA Rosettes. The kitchen is small but extremely well laid out so that it is easy to produce the same quality and quantity of meals as much larger kitchens with a lot less running around. If you like walking this is the place for you as it is set extremely near to the breathtaking Brecon Beacons. The wine list complements the 2AAR Fare and they won the best Wine List for Wales and overall in the 2AA Rosette 2012 guide. You will need live out for this position. Salary is set at **** to **** per annum, which is on the money for the area. Call John now quoting reference **** if you have any interest or revisit (url removed) for other positions. Please do not apply for this position unless you have an absolute right to work in the UK, have good English and have at least 2 years experience as a Head Chef at a similar 2AA Rosette establishment
