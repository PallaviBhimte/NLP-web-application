Description: IFS Technical Developer required by my South UK based IFS client, My client is looking for an experienced IFS Developer to join their expanding team due to heavy project work forecast for the coming year. The following skills are required: IFS, Crystal Reports, XML, Web Services, API's and Cognos. The position will be a mixture of daytoday support of the IFS system to 2nd/3rd line level, and project based activities. Initially the successful applicant will need to work on a project that involves heavy XML and Web Services as the client is looking to change certain peripheral systems which will involve an entire platform change. There is also some heavy data cleansing and data migration/integration into IFS. Crystal Reports experience is essential as analytics will be key to project success, and Cognos experience is strongly desirable. The position requires strong XML, PL/SQL, SQL, API'S, and IFS knowledge and experience, please do not apply if you do not have the above. This is an excellent opportunity to develop your IFS and development career within a supportive and rewarding environment where training, excellent salary and a competitive benefits package are on offer.
