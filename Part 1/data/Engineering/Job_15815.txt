Description: Introduction Our client are a world leader in the defence industry who design and develop defence systems for the international market. Now recruiting for a Principal Engineer  PCB Design Technologies Important PCB Expert The Job Role Title: Principal Engineer, PCB Technologies Role Purpose: To select PCB technologies for boards on projects taking into account the needs of cost, reliability and ability to survive the product environmental requirements. Accountabilities: Propose PCB technologies and board layups for projects, compatible with the requirements of the circuit design and environmental requirements and commensurate with the equipment mechanical packaging schemes and Bare Board PCB supplier capabilities. Use simulation and modelling tools to perform mechanical shock and vibration plus thermal modelling of boards. Provide modelling data for PCB s to Mechanical Engineering to ensure coherence in the design process at overall packaging level. Participate in maintaining harmonised (mainly UK/Fr) technical standards amp; process documentation for PCB layout and board assembly. This activity requires periodic international travel by air/rail. Identify research topics, provide support amp; technical leadership to deliver research activities including external collaborative projects. Provide specialist advice and support across projects and to other functions as appropriate, for instance, in the selection of PCB Suppliers. Performance Indicators: Tasks achieved to time and budget New ideas and methods successfully adopted in technical standards amp;/or process documentation Packaging solutions progressed from concept through to production without major alteration Skills and Knowledge: Ideally degree qualified or equivalent Relevant experience in the field of PCB technologies, including: Board( amp; Interconnect) Level The effects of Environments on PCB s (vibration, temperature, humidity, altitude, etc) Mechanical design considerations (mounting, chassis, materials, mass, etc) Board technology selection (rigid, flexrigid, flexible, ceramic, etc) Interconnect selection (flexirigid, flexible circuits, sculptured, cable, etc) PCB construction amp; layer definitions High Speed / Signal Integrity design constraints Board thermal characteristics amp; constraints Board manufacturing amp; assembly techniques amp; processes PCB fabricators/procurement liaison amp; support Designing for Produceability, Testability, Rework/Repair, Environment, Reliability Component Level Awareness of component packaging technologies (construction, assembly), materials (characteristics, selection), COTS, PEDs, connector types, etc Tools Experience of working with Mentor (legacy) amp;/or preferably Zuken CR**** (current tool) for schematic entry, board outline amp; placement Capability to perform thermal amp; mechanical modeling Personal Attributes Work proactively, as part of a team and/or on their own initiative as the situation demands Demonstrate a strong selfmotivation and commitment to achieve tasks on time and to a high professional standard Willingness to work openly and share information with peers Additional Information Working effectively in collaboration with mechanical amp; electronic designers, PCB layout group, PCB fabricators amp; manufacturing (board assembly) Being able to clearly communicate to mechanical amp; electronic designers any PCB limitations associated with their initial proposals and influencing the adoption of alternative solutions Working to tight or critical timescales, identifying and addressing critical aspects as a priority Maintaining amp; harmonising technical standards amp; process documentation in an international (UK/Fr) context To apply for this position, candidates must be eligible to live and work in the UK and be able to gain security clearance prior to the start date.
