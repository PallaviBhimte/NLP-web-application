Title: Pricing Actuary  London Market
Webindex: 71445787
Company: Oliver James Associates
Description: Excellent opportunity for a nearly qualified GI Actuary to move into a London Market pricing role with a globally renowned insurance group. Previous Pricing experience is advantageous but not essential. Also involves adhoc reserving and capital work on occasion. My client is a world leader in the Insurance market and this is a fantastic opportunity to gain handson London Market pricing experience (about 70% of your time) while maintaining or bulding skills in reserving or capital. You will work closely with the Senior Pricing Actuary who is a highly supportive individual that can greatly assist your development of advanced pricing skills regardless of your current experience. This role requires someone who is part or nearly qualified and has excellent communication skills. You will be required to advise underwriters on a weekly basis and so the ability to work well with nonactuaries is essential.
