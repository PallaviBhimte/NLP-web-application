Description: Are you looking to start the New Year with a new challenge? I am currently looking to recruit a 3D CAD/REVIT Technician to join rapidly expanding, building services Design Consultancy that specialise in Mechanical and Electrical design engineering. They are a small but extremely ambitious Design consultancy, so this will offer someone a great opportunity to get in at ground level and grow with the company as it expands, so career potential is second to none. The position would suit a 3D CAD REVIT Technician with a can do attitude , and they are after a good team player who wants to work in a friendly relaxed working environment. The role will suit a career orientated person looking for an excellent long term career opportunity. The ideal candidate will have commercial experience in 3D CAD Revit Software and also previous experience within an M&E design consultancy.

Any 3D modelling experience would also be beneficial but this is not a necessity. They are based out of high spec serviced offices in a fantastic rural location, but are just a few minutes off the M1 in Luton so are extremely accessible. This is a fantastic career opportunity and is not to be missed, so if you would like to discuss further please contact Richard Hallam at Sumo Recruitment.
