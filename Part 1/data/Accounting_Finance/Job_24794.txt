It is important that you have proven credit control skills ideally in a smaller business where you will have gained more 'hands on' type experience as the job will also involve not just chasing debts by telephone email letters etc but cash allocation and also sorting queries on invoices from customers. Their is a possibility that this contract could run on for some time due to the nature of maternity leave so it is important that we find somebody who is a committed individual and although there is no guarantee there may be a possibility of a permanent role in the business. My Client are a long established family owned business who we have known for several years and who treat their staff well and fairly and there is definitely a very friendly and warm team in place who we are sure will treat you like one of the team should you join them  If you can start work immediately and live close to Tile Hill in Coventry and have proven credit This job was originally posted as www.totaljobs.com/JobSeeking/TemporaryCreditControllerMaternityCover_job****
