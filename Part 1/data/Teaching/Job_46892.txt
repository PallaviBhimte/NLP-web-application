Description: Deadline: **** th February ****013. This studentship is available for an October ****013 start. Supervisory Team: Primary: Professor David Richardson Secondary: Dr Andrew Gates, Dr Gary Rowley The Project: Nitrous oxide (N****O) is estimated to contribute up to 9% of the global radiative forcing of greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture accounts for 70% of anthropogenic atmospheric loading of N****O, which is largely microbial in origin. Understanding the environmental factors that control N****O production and consumption by microbes is a critical and major challenge on the road to developing practical mitigation strategies for N****O emissions. Denitrifying bacteria play an important global role in the synthesis and consumption of N****O, but very little work has been done on studying the regulatory networks that modulate the assembly and activity of the biochemical apparatus that catalyses production and destruction of the greenhouse gas. Critically, N****O reduction is dependent on the Cucontaining enzyme NosZ. As arable lands become more intensively exploited Cudeficiency is also becoming a more acute global concern. For example, it was recently estimated that around ****0% of arable lands in Europe are biologically Cu deficient. We have shown that under nitraterich, Cudepleted conditions, denitrifying bacterial cultures release N****O at >100 times the rate of Cureplete cultures. We have undertaken the first global transcription analysis of a denitrifying respiratory network and this has shown a clear regulation of the nos genes by Cu, which leads to the downregulation of the NosZ enzyme. From an environmental point of view this is potentially significant because it leads to the emission of N2O. The resulting impact on N2O release is very pronounced with 40% of nitrate input into the system being released as this potent greenhouse gas. The problem of N2O emission by bacteria is recognised globally as a huge environmental issue. In recognition of this a prestigious University Scholarship is available for a PhD programme to study the biochemistry of the assembly and regulation of the enzyme that destroy nitrous oxide, NosZ. The research programme will include protein expression, protein biochemistry, protein structure and spectroscopy and proteinDNA interaction studies. Entry Requirements: A first or upper second class UK honours degree, or the equivalent qualifications gained outside the UK, in Biochemistry, Microbiology, Genetics, Chemistry or Environmental Sciences. Funding: Funding will cover a stipend and tuition fees for UK and EU students, and is available for a maximum of 3 years. The current stipend for 2013/**** is **** per annum.
