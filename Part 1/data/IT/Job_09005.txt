Title: PHP Developer  Bristol
Webindex: 70229148
Description: Are you a highly skilled PHP developer who knows Drupal and WordPress inside out with great frontend build skills to boot? With a flood of new work on the horizon we are looking for someone to work in house on all our PHP and front end development on a contract basis for this busy period. Specifically we are looking for someone with strong Drupal and WordPress skills together with equally strong HTML, CSS and Javascript. As we are a small studio we would be looking for a team player and someone to occasionally wear a couple of hats, role up their sleeves and get stuck in. You will be responsible for the development of website projects from requirements analysis through the complete development lifecycle to deployment. You will work directly with the Creative team, but managing the technical aspects of the project yourself. As the contract is for a 6 months we would be looking to interview people and get references to make sure the person was right for the role.
