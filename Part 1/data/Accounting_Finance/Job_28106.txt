Company: Huxley Associates
Description: Linux/Windows Systems Admin  Opportunity to cross train into Middleware Tech Salary: ****K 25% Cash Benefits (****K TC)  up to 20% Bonus Location:Cambridge A unique opportunity has arisen within one of my top tier financial clients in Cambridge for a Linux or Windows focused IT Systems Administrator to join and train up to become an IT Middleware Engineer with a broad infrastructure technology skill set. Alternatively, if you already have good Middleware Support skills, there is the opportunity to join the team as an experienced member. IT Middleware is a growth area and incorporates computer software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. This opportunity is within a new team as a result of growth of the business so is the perfect opportunity for a motivated, hungry technologist to learn some niche, highly valuable skills in a mixed Linux and Windows environment. Because of the growth of this team, there will be subject matter expert and potential team lead openings long term in this space so this is a fantastic career opportunity. The systems the team support are focused upon Oracle Web Fusion, Oracle Identity Management, Microsoft Sharepoint and IBM Sterling, so any knowledge or exposure to these technologies would be extremely advantageous but not essential. If you do not have any knowledge or exposure to middleware technologies then ideally this person should have a couple of years experience in Linux or Windows based IT support and be able to show they are capable and genuinely interested in learning a number of new technologies.
