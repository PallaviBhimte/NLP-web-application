Company: Ad Lib
Description: A media sales opportunity in Hereford? Brilliant That`s right We`re working with a fantastic media organisation in Hereford that is looking to swell their ranks further with the addition of an exciting and talented media sales executive. A fastmoving and dynamic company, they produce a highend b2b magazine and website and the right person for this role will be joining them in one of their marketleading sectors. Already established as a sales person, ideally you`ll have some media experience under your belt enabling you to hit the ground running to sell a range of advertising and subscription solutions cross format, both online and in print. You should be able to work under pressure and meet deadlines as well as be constantly striving to smash your sales targets month in, month out. A selfstarter, generating new business opportunities should come naturally to you, allowing you to maximise each prospect that comes your way. It`s not all about cold calling though. Relationships are equally important here so being able to develop and nurture existing accounts will stand you in very good stead indeed. It`s not all office work either You`ll be expected to attend conferences and exhibitions, seminars and networking events too which will enable you to become a real specialist in your field. There are some fantastic benefits that come with working here too, including pension, health schemes and life insurance. And all that on top of a salary up to ****k and an upcapped OTE. If you like the sound of all of this then simply send your CV in to us today. This job was originally posted as www.totaljobs.com/JobSeeking/MediaSalesExecutiveb2bpublications_job****
