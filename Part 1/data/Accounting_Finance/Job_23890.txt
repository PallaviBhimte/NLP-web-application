Description: The company has retained a boutique feel to its working environment, and as such there is a collegiate, relaxed atmosphere, where collectively they are highly successful. With a continued development of their UK client base they are looking to add a senior member to the team, with a focus on Institutional clients. To be considered, you will be a selfstarter, with an entrepreneurial mindset who is looking for the freedom to business develop in the way that you see fit.
