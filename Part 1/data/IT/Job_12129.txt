Description: Equities trade floor based Front Office adhoc support/RAD Developer, Excel, VBA, SQL, .Net, C, MS Office application automation, application support. This growing and progressive Investment Bank is looking for a multitalented individual to join a small team which works on adhoc support and development for the entire cash equities trade floor. This varied role will involve providing ongoing operational support of the NONvendor based systems which the Front Office users utilise, this includes ongoing development of trader/equity analyst owned spreadsheets  so excel and VBA knowledge (macros and advanced formulas etc) is essential, as is related SQL server development. In addition to this the team automates various MS Office 2010 applications using .net based technologies so some experience with .NET is also important. The tradefloor needs someone who has worked within Cash Equities and associated common IT systems previously (ie market data feeds etc) for this role as they need this person to be able to hit the ground running to help users get the most out of their systems. The bank uses Fidessa and RIMS but knowledge of these is not necessary as they are hosted systems, any knowledge of Factset though would be an advantage. This is an excellent opportunity for someone with the relevant experience who is looking to move into a highly visible and responsible role on a growing trade floor, this is often a high pressure environment but can also be equally rewarding once relationships and trust have been built between the person who takes this role and the Front Office users, this is the key challenge for the role.
