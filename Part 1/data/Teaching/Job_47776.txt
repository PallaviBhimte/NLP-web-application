Webindex: 72448966
Company: Simply Angelic
Description: Simply Angelic specialise in placing qualified and experienced Nannies with Families overseas. The roles available vary dramatically from junior nanny roles for newly qualified nannies with some UK experience but looking for their first role overseas, to very demanding positions in formal households requiring many years previous overseas experience. Naturally, the salaries also vary and will depend on the specific requirements of the role  hours and days per week, flexibility required, amount of experience and qualifications required, location, and many other factors. We usually have roles available rangeing **** per week to around **** per week, so whichever stage of your professional nanny career you are currently, we will usually have a role for you. We deal with most worldwide locations, but always have a selection of nice jobs in France, Greece, Turkey, Italy, Switzerland, Monaco, Dubai, Moscow, and Bermuda. (We also place nannies in Central London) If you are a qualified nanny with 1 years full time sole charge experience, or have 2 years of full time sole charge experience we'd love to hear from you. If you have worked overseas previously, either in a holiday company, or in a private Family, we'd definitely love to hear from you ASAP. You will need a clear CRB (we can help with administering this), good references from previous employers, and be able to commit to at least one year's employment. For more information, please email a copy of your CV to overseassimplyangelic.co.uk and let us help to find your next overseas placement.
