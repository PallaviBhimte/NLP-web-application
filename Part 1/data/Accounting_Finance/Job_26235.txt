Webindex: 69088165
Company: Goodman Masson
Description: Despite sitting in the Product Control department, this is not a standard P&L production position. In fact, Accounting responsibilities are extremely minimal in what is a highly technical, high profile position within the department. The person in this role will take over one of the exotic business lines covering risk production/Calculations and P&L (Explains/Generation). The role will also include heavy exposure to the Trading Desk (at times much of your responsibility will relate to performing the role of a Desk Assistant), Quants and Market Risk. You will be heavily involved in new Trading strategies and general business proposals that will effect the department. Due to the exposure that the role provides, this is a great opportunity for the candidate to then progress into a Market Risk or a Front Office position if they chose not to head up a team within this department The client is looking for somebody that has had good exposure to and knowledge of either Risk or P&L, ideally both, from an FX/Rates background or any other Exotics/Structured Products asset class. An accountancy qualification is not necessary, however, it is seen as being a major advantage, as is a Science/Maths Academic background in what it a highly complex, challenging role. It is imperative that you have excellent communication skills and the confidence/desire to constantly face off against Head Traders and Senior Management. The role pays a strong basic salary in comparison with their competitors. Furthermore, there is an excellent benefits scheme alongside a bonus payment that should also be strong within the current market due to the recent success of the business.
