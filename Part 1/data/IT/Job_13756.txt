Description: Senior Research Storage Analyst Increasingly the ICR s research programmes are dependent on major IT systems such as High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities and Petascale storage platforms. The Institute s researchers currently make use of both a SAN based solution that is in the process of being upgraded and a Petascale hierarchical NAS storage system running a Linux OS. The SAN is managed by the IT Technical Services team while the NAS is operated by the Scientific Computing team. The ICR is creating a new role to administer its current storage platforms and to contribute to future storage strategy. To that end we are recruiting a highly experienced Senior Research Storage Analyst who will join both the Scientific Computing and Technical Services teams. The expected ratio of time spent between the two teams is expected to be a ****:**** split.

Candidates should have a good track record of working with a variety of both SAN and NAS technologies, with experience of multitiered hierarchical platforms being highly advantageous. The role requires the abilities to work both within a team but also to take responsibility for regular system administration issues as an individual.
