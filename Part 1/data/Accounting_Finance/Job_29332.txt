All accounts must be French focused, and applicants must have the ability to demonstrate previous PnL history. To summarise, you must meet the following criteria in order to be considered for this position  Have mid level/associate level experience across Structured Products Sales  Have cross asset / hybrid asset experience ( must include equities)  Have a transferable client base targeting retail accounts  Account base must be focused on France.
