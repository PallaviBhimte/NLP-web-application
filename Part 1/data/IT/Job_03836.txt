You will be involved in the full development life cycle from the idea's inception to its delivery. Along with this you must have extensive knowledge of C.net and surrounding skills.

Additional exposure to C, Javascript or Linux is beneficial but by no means essential. In return for this you will be offered a state of the art working environment and excellent benefits (including share scheme and flexible working).
