Description: 2ndLine Desktop Support Engineer – VMWare Client Installation and Support (VDI Machine) Project.

Someone who has dealt with a wide range of installation and support issues in the past. Windows XP, Dell Desktops, Wyse Thin Clients, Network Printing, Encryption Software, PC moves and changes (installs), Knowledge of Active Directory and MS Outlook, confident knowledge of Windows Server/Networking (sufficient to do 2ndline PC support work), ideally practical experience of VMware thin client installations and configuration, although this is not essential as long as you can clearly explain your understanding of this technology. NHS experience is a real advantage (but not essential) as work in this environment can be quite different to other organisations and the way support is organised may be unusual to you. The IT department supports over **** users of PCs across a large campus in south west London. You will be working as part of a small project team, of c.**** people, installing and support thin client/”VMware view client” machines as part of a strategy for change within the NHS Trust. This will require STRONG 2ndline desktop support skills – including PC moves, installs and configuration. You will need to be able to add new users on a network and resolve network printing problems, etc. Any knowledge of VMware thin client installations would be useful. Personality and communication skills are also very important as you will be dealing with a diverse range of users, some of whom may not be too technical. A friendly personality is a must. Preference will be given to NHS or other suitable experience. Essential skills include Windows XP, (ideally Dell) Desktop and Laptop experience, Thin client technology, Network Printing, Encryption Software, PC moves and changes (installs/configuration), Knowledge of Active Directory and MS Outlook, basic knowledge of Windows Server/Networking (sufficient to do 2ndline PC Support). NHS experience is a real advantage, but not essential. Contract likely to be extended as this could turn in to a big project across the whole estate.
