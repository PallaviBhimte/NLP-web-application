Policy on employment of persons with criminal convictions Enara will protect its Customers against potential abuse by making all necessary statutory Criminal Records checks on its employees. At the same time it will not discriminate unfairly against those with spent convictions, and will follow employment best practice in this regard. The general principle is that no one should “have his present pulled from under his feet by his past”. Home Care is one of the many professions which is exempted from the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act. This means that ALL convictions have to be declared. Cautions, reprimands and final warnings are not convictions, so are “spent” at once, but they DO have to be declared for home care work. The suitability for employment of a person with a criminal record will vary, depending on the nature of the job and the details and circumstance of any convictions. An honest declaration at the recruitment stage will be considered positively, whereas attempting to withhold conviction information to gain employment will count against a person in the decision whether to employ them, or whether to confirm or continue employment if this comes to light later.
