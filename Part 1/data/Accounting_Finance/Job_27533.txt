Description: Our client is looking for an ambitious and driven individual to lead the fund accounting division for this newly formed fund. We are looking for a qualified accountant with a strong background in fund accounting for private equity and real estate structure to help the CFO to set up and then ultimately lead this area. Currently this role will be hands on in all aspects but has the potential to grow into a broader and varied role because of the backing and nature of the investments the fund plans to make. This represents a genuinely exciting time to join this business.
