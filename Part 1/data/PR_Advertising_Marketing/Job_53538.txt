Webindex: 68681722
Company: The Bridge Consultancy
Description: The largest independent healthcare advertising agency in the UK (and actually one of the top 50 Advertising Agencies) has an exciting opportunity for a Copywriter, possibly with a background in corporate communications, to join the dynamic creative department of this awardwinning healthcare agency. The company is based in new offices overlooking Windsor Castle and handles campaigns for some of the biggest brands from some of the bestknown pharmaceutical companies in the world. We are looking for a writer with a strong portfolio of above and below the line work to work with Art Directors and other creatives, tackling challenging creative briefs and producing a wide range of communications materials, including journal ads, brochures, fact sheets, websites and radio and TV commercials. Candidates should be strong conceptual thinkers, who can vary their writing style to the target audience, including pharmaceutical industry executives, healthcare professionals, clinicians, GPs, investors or patients. It is rare for this agencyto only propose the standard healthcare fare of press ads and detail aids, so we are looking for a Creative who has a flexible and medianeutral approach to their work. The ideal candidate should have a science or medical background, or knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry, including working within ABPI guidelines. You will be someone who ‘gets’ the science and can turn complex information into simple, surprising and empathetic work. You’ll be an awardwinning Copywriter, and as such you understand the valuable role creativity plays in unlocking a brand’s true value, and as one half of a Creative Team, we can guarantee you an agency environment that is fuelled by challenge and opportunity. Along with a good salary there is an excellent benefits package including health insurance, life assurance, personal pension to which the company contributes a minimum of 5% of salary, quarterly guaranteed performancerelated bonus, annual bonus, corporate gym membership, and interestfree travel or parking loans.
