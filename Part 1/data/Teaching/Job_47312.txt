Company: PROTOCOL EDUCATION
Description: Protocol Education have recently launched 'Narrowing the Gap' a new service that provides pupil support interventions and tuition services to schools. The challenge of closing attainment gaps and ensuring pupil progress, particularly for disadvantaged pupils, is one faced by most schools and academies and evidence from the nationwide 'Making Good Progress' pilot has shown that targeted additional staffing can help. Therefore, we are looking to recruit qualified teachers at both Primary and Secondary level to work as tutors in our client schools in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, working onetoone or taking small groups of children who require a little extra support in Literacy and Numeracy. 'Narrowing the Gap' provides highly targeted support to those groups of pupils where progress is not being made and where the attainment gap is most marked. The children you will be working with will:  Have entered a Key Stage below age related expectations  Be Secondary pupils who need catch up support in basic numeracy and literacy  Be EAL pupils who require additional help to fulfil their potential  Be SEN pupils in mainstream classes who would benefit from specific onetoone help So, if you have Qualified Teacher Status and would be interested in this type of role then please call the Protocol office in Nottingham on **** **** **** or log on to www.protocoleducation.com and register your details to arrange a meeting.
