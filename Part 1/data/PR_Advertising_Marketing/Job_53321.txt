Webindex: 68540640
Company: ALEXANDER JAMES RECRUITMENT LTD
Description: My client is a leading PR agency based in the South East with a team focussing on clients in the business to business, financial services and professional services sector. Their clients have come to expect the best. The team consistently delivers superior results, working to the highest quality at all times. There is now an opportunity for someone to rise to the challenge of being part of that team. The role is demanding and challenging, both intellectually and creatively and you will have already developed excellent media relations and client handling skills. You will need to be able to manage and prioritise your own workload, relishing the opportunity to take responsibility for your own projects. This is an environment where everyone works hard and it is very much a team effort, where everyone will work together to meet deadlines. You will have a keen interest in current affairs and real passion for the media. You will enjoy the intellectual stimulus of your work, be self motivated and expect to deliver work of a high standard from the outset. You will already have PR experience either in a PR agency or be client side. In return you will benefit both financially and intellectually. Once you have proven your abilities, you will be given every opportunity to continue to grow as a PR professional. You will participate in the new business process, be given creative and analytical challenges in issues management and internal communications. Potential and promise will be demanded, career development and progression will be the reward.
