Title: BBSRC PhD studentship: Evolutionary ecology of fungal killers
Webindex: 69568867
Company: University of Exeter
Description: Supervisors: Dr Ivana Gudelj and Professor Ken Haynes, Biosciences, University of Exeter We are looking to recruit a highlymotivated and dedicated student with a real interest in applying evolutionary biology to antimicrobial resistance and we are inviting applications for this BBSRCfunded PhD studentship to commence September ****013. Fungal diseases devastate human lives. Bloodstream infections are the second biggest killer of hospital patients with almost 50% of infections proving fatal, leading to 1.5 million patient deaths worldwide each year. However, fungal infections are not wellunderstood and there is much less public awareness than for diseases caused by bacterial and viral infections. We therefore urgently need to understand how fungal pathogens evolve, adapt to different environments and become resistant to drugs. This is the research goal of a fullyfunded PhD scholarship in Biosciences at the University of Exeter. The successful applicant will participate in a lively research environment where we combine mathematical modeling with an experimental evolutionary approach to build new theories and test them in the lab. We are looking for PhD students, either experimental or theoretical with a biological or a physics background, to join our interdisciplinary team in a unique environment where theoreticians and experimentalists share a common research vision. We expect to apply diverse experimental and theoretical tools, from the molecular and genetic to the evolutionary and ecological, depending on the successful candidate and full training will be provided as appropriate. You must have obtained, or be about to obtain, a First or Upper Second Class UK Honours degree, or the equivalent qualifications gained outside the UK, in Biology, Physics, Mathematics or a relevant subject. The studentship will cover a stipend for up to four years at the standard Research Council rate (**** per annum for 20132014), research costs and tuition fees at the UK/EU rate for students who meet the residency requirements outlined by BBSRC (see http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/web/FILES/Guidelines/studentship_eligibility.pdf ). Students from EU countries who do not meet the residency requirements may still be eligible for a feesonly award.
