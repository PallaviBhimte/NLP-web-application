Description: We are currently headhunting for a Territory Manager for the South West and South Wales Region for the UK for a Medical Capital / Consumable Products company. Our client is a leading provider of theatre products, both small scale capital equipment and ongoing consumables for the relevant capital products. Due to continual success and also due to the fact that our client is now on the PASA / NHS Framework Agreement, their focus is now to develop further areas within the sales team. The product area is suction equipment for Operating Theatres, with some associated disposable products. The unique element to this role is that the position offers a step into Theatre Sales, without having to have a clinical operating theatre background or a theatre sales background. The client is flexible on experience levels, as long as you have a proven track record in sales and make a good fit for their company culture. Full training will be given. The role is selling to all theatres / EBME / Procurement / Infection Control professional, from the clinical teams and the business / procurement teams. The sort of person who would be ideal for this role would be a tenacious and autonomous sales professional who knows the NHS buying structure well, and is looking to join a progressive company, and likes to reward its employees well. As mentioned, Theatre experience is not an essential, for the right person.
