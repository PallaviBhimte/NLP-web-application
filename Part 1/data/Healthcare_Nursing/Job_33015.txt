The Home has been under the present owner’s jurisdiction since the late eighties and continues to go from strength to strength, year on year with 97% occupancy. The Home itself has been praised for the calming, relaxed environment which it has created for residents and their families. This is largely down to the company’s ability to hire and retain the very best members of staff.
