Due to a sustain period of growth in our client base as well as our regular customers become more active we are now looking for an additional consultant to join the company. This role will involve working closely with our clients to define job specifications and then engage with suitable candidates through a variety of mediums. You will work closely with both applicant and client to ensure that both parties are being represented professionally and that ultimately we help the employer find the best person for the job and the candidate the best job for them. We are not a sales focused 'agency' so our focus is more on finding the best match for all parties. As a fullyfledged consultant you will also be tasked with discovering and developing business opportunities with new customers, demonstrating the difference in the level of service we offer and establishing longterm recruitment partnerships.We are able to consider applicants at all levels of experience; from those looking to commence a career in the recruitment industry through to experienced recruiters seeking a new challenge with greater prospects and autonomy. All applicants must be educated to degree level (or equivalent) and be able to demonstrate experience of working in a customerservice role (either facetoface or telephone based). Applicants must possess good analytical skills as they will be required to understand complex job descriptions and technical CVs and make prompt assessments of applicant's strengths, weaknesses and suitability for vacancies. With clients based in Germany, The Netherlands and Scandinavia it would be a bonus if applicants spoke a second language however this is by no means essential.As we are an independent company, we are able to be flexible in terms of salary and bonus structures and, within reason; we will pay what it takes to secure the best person for us. We are looking for a highly selfmotivated person to help us continue to give a recruitment service that is second to none. Our long term plans will involve expansion into Europe and beyond so successful consultants could look forward to setting out to expand our client basis in a specific location and then establishing an office there, if desired.If this advert has struck a chord with you and you feel that you can offer the commitment, hard work and experience we are looking for, whatever your level of recruitment experience, please feel free to send us your CV, or contact me via LinkedIn to arrange an initial informal discussion.Novate IT Ltd is a leading supplier of permanent and contract recruitment services for companies in the IT, Digital Media and Telecommunications industries.
