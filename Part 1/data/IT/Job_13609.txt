Description: Python, API's, OO, Ajax, Linux, git, SVN, SQL I am currently looking for a Python Developer to join a company that is currently expanding rapidly. They are the number one company in their field and are looking for a fun, friendly and highly technical Python Developer to join the team. They promote a very relaxed working culture, they expect you achieve targets and deadlines but also appreciate that some people do things quicker than others. With this in mind they allow flexible working, work the hours that you need to in order to get the job done. You would be joining a small team and would have the chance to work very closely with a Technical Lead who has a wealth of experience in development. You will not just be a number in a large development team where you are expected to just get on with it. This role will give the successful candidate the opportunity to learn and grow; as the team grows you will be best placed to move into a more senior position as time goes on. You will be a passionate developer with 23 years of experience developing in Python; you will also bring with you your own ideas. They are not looking for someone that will just go with the flow, they actively encourage people to put forward their own ideas and contribute towards the business growth. If this sounds like it is made for you then please send me your CV now and I will call you to discuss in much more detail.
