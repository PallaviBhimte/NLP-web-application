Webindex: 70781848
Company: BIAARS
Description: Oracle RightNow Consultant My client is a boutique Business Intelligence and CRM consultancy and they are looking for an experienced RightNow Consultant to join the team. This is a great opportunity to cross train into other leading CRM and BI technologies in order for you to become an allround elite solutions specialist. You should already be an established RightNow consultant or a highly experienced developer looking to make the jump into consultancy. Therefore excellent customer facing and communication skills are essential. Key technical skills include up to date knowledge of Oracle RightNow software. Although many of the customers are based in London and South East, you may be required to stay away on projects elsewhere in the UK. Unfortunately our client is unable to sponsor work permits so the role is only open to candidates who have the existing right to work in the UK. Biaars operates as both an employment agency and employment business and is an equal opportunities employer. Unfortunately we are only able to respond to successful applications.
