I am currently recruiting for a Head Chef to take the reins and lead a **** strong brigade through busy services, assisting with progression of the junior chefs and liaising with owners to ensure profitability. You must have a background of leading a team within a kitchen and not have been away from the stoves. This Head Chef position is very hands on, leading from the front. Of course there are members in the brigade that can hold their own, but my client is looking for a Head Chef that can really set an example and be there to ensure everything works how it should do. As Head Chef you must have exceptional man management skills, a calm level head and an eye for business, making the right financial decisions in the kitchen and importantly a good deal of consistency. Cooking up to **** covers on a busy evening, it is important that the new Head Chef is physically fit and enjoys the pressure.

With a warm yet contemporary atmosphere in the renovation of the old building it is in as well as the dcor is matched by the menu with enough items to keep Head Chef busy without being too much.
