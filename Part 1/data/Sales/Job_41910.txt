Company: GEMINI SEARCH
Description: My client is one of the fastest growing consumer publishers in the UK with a string of awards to their name and two of the most recognised men's and woman's weekly magazines in the country. Over the past two years, their digital offering has become a giant killer, maintaining a similar level of success to their print titles and carrying some of the biggest consumer advertisers from the Entertainment, Fashion and Technology sector. This success has spawned an opening for a senior digital media agency sales person to join their team, opening up a world of financial and long term career opportunities. If you have at least ****  3 years consumer media sales experience, selling to agencies and are looking for that step up to work on a hugely successful team in a rapidly growing company, please send your CVs to me at adamgeminisearch.co.uk.
