Description: Domiciliary Care Coordinator  North London An experienced, compassionate, organised, and qualityfocused candidate to work as Care Coordinator in their wellestablished and large domiciliary care branch in North London, covering several different local authorities. Previous Care Coordination or Care Supervisory experience in domiciliary care is essential for this role due to the nature of this branch. My clients require someone who has the 'knack' for Coordinating and can manage their time well and the pressures of the job, as it is very hectic This established care company is proud of its longestablished reputation, and itâ€™s staff ethos of working as a team. You will be rostering using IT allocation systems such as Cold Harbour or Staff Plan, for which training will be provided, but if you have experience of using rostering systems before it would be highly advantageous. You will be allocating hours to carers and liaising with Social Services, but in addition you will be carrying out occasional initial assessments and spot checks on carers, participating in the oncall rota, taking a lead on any disciplinary procedures, and overseeing the provision of highquality care to clients in their own homes. If you would be interested in this excellent opportunity to work as part of a progressive organisation, please apply to Mark Dacre at Service Care Solutions on **** **** now
