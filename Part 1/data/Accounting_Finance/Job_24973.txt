Description: As an insurance claims handler, you'll deal with every aspect of an insurance claim on behalf of your clients. A claim is usually the result of loss caused by events such as fire, flood, theft, accident or illness. If your client is insured and the policy conditions are met, they will receive compensation from the insurance company. You will handle the whole process, from first notice to final payment. This can get complex, and a loss adjuster may also be involved. You'll handle the relevant documentation, ensure that the process runs smoothly, that the insurance company settles in the correct manner, and that your client receives their compensation as quickly as possible. Your routine tasks are likely to include: Liaising with the insured party to take full details of a claim Working with the loss adjuster or insurer to ensure the claim is genuine Liaising with the broker who placed the risk, and the underwriters Ensuring a fair settlement for the client in the event of a claim Communicating with both sides to ensure that the client is receiving good service Advising clients on insurance issues in general. As well as handling claims for personal clients, you may also deal with commercial and business claims. Previous claims or financial services experience will be required.
