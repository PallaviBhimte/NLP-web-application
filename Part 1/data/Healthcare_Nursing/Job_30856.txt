Webindex: 50255548
Description: The role of the care worker is to perform duties and tasks to facilitate our customers to live at home in a safe secure and comfortable way. Care Worker Job Duties It is sometimes difficult to generalise about what the role of a care worker is. The best way of summing it up is that we might perform the tasks carried out by a close friend or relative but in a trained, professional and knowledgeable way. In order to do this successfully the care worker must be aware of the needs and requirements of the customer and must communicate successfully not only with the customer but also with other stakeholders such as family, friends and other healthcare professionals. The care worker also has a responsibility to alert the supervisor (or their representative) of any changes or causes for concern in the customer's condition. There will be specific tasks identified for a particular customer. These may include cooking and/or preparing meals and possibly assistance with feeding. Housekeeping and laundry as well as personal care may also be part of the role. The care worker will be briefed before undertaking any assignment with the specific tasks involved but in every case it is incumbent upon the care worker to carry out the work in a safe and professional way and to adhere to the specific instructions as well as the policies and procedures of the company. Care workers are frequently the only people that a customer may see on a daily basis and clearly there is a responsibility to report any relevant information back to the supervisor. It is not the role of the care worker to become involved in notifying family, friends or relatives of changes. This will be carried out by the Bluebird Care admin team, based on the advice received from the care worker. Thecare worker does not have responsibility for staff. It should be clearly understood that the role requires a great deal, sometimes both in physical and emotional ways, and also carries a weight of responsibility. Anyone who does not genuinely care about the welfare of other people will not be suitable for this job. By its nature domiciliary care requires care workers to travel from place to place. Care workers must therefore have the ability to do this, either by public transport or by their own means. A thorough training programme is applicable to every member of the Bluebird Care team. This constitutes both initial and ongoing training and is a requirement of all staff. Every member of staff will be required to apply for, and achieve, a satisfactory Criminal Records Bureau check.
