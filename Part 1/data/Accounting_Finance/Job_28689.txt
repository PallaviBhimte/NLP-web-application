Working in a small specialist Motor team within a larger claims office, you will hold responsibility for your own case load of claims and be given autonomy to manage your own time and priorities. To be considered for this opportunity it is essential you have previous Motor Personal Injury claims handling experience, gained within an insurer environment.
