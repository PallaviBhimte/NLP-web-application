Company: Teaching Support
Description: We are working with a residential PRU in Swanley who are looking for an English teacher to cover until the end of the academic year. Although they would ideally like an English specialist they will also consider a teacher with a background in Humanities. The school is situated in a rural location in beautiful grounds and benefits from excellent facilities. The ideal candidate will have experience of working within SEN and in particular will have strong behavior management techniques. You will be teaching across KS**** and **** and so it is essential that you have experience of teaching up to GCSE. This is a full time post until the end of the academic year. The children at the school come from a mixture of backgrounds but all have a statement of SEN. The behavior can be challenging but class sizes are very small (**** pupils) and the school benefits from a dedicated and experienced senior leadership team and provides a strong and supportive environment for all of the staff. It is a hugely rewarding role and would suit someone who is passionate about making a difference to the lives of children who really need that extra support. We would love to hear from you if you are an English or Humanities teacher in or around the Swanley area and you can commit until at least the end of the academic year. Please contact us for more information.
