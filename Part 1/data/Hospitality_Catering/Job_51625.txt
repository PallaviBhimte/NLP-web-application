Description: Sous Chef  Leather Bottle, RG**** ****JU We’re looking for an experienced sous chef with excellent cooking skills, experience in helping to set and achieve GP percentages and the ability to manage high volumes with the right standards of quality and consistency. Our menu has a spine of freshly prepared, classic British dishes, complemented by more exotic influences from other parts of the world: in other words, modern British cookery. Our passion lies in finding quality ingredients and preparing, cooking and presenting them in a modern but unpretentious way. Together with the head chef you will help write the menus, assist in sourcing ingredients from the best suppliers and set and maintain the highest standards of food quality and consistency. You’ll also need to run service in the head chef’s absence and so your kitchen management and organisational skills will be of paramount importance. This is a vital role in the pub and is an excellent stepping stone on the road to managing your own kitchen. As a Sous Chef we’ll reward you with a salary package around **** and you’ll be part of a successful, growing company who have been awarded Pub Group of the Year on five occasions. We have a website at www.leatherbottle.hcpr.co.uk but it’s also worth having a good look through the Brunning and Price website at www.brunningandprice.co.uk to get a feel of where we're heading .
