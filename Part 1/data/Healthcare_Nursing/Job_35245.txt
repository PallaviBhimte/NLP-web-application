Description: Domiciliary Care Coordinator  Bromley A fantastic opportunity has arisen for a Domiciliary Care Coordinator to work within a growing domiciliary care agency in Bromley, Kent. An experienced, compassionate, organised, and qualityfocused candidate is required to work as Care Coordinator in my clients’ wellestablished, prestigious and highquality domiciliary care branch in Bromley, providing care in the community to private clients and some local authority clients via spot contracts. Previous Care Coordination or Care Supervisory experience within a domiciliary care agency setting is essential for this role due to the nature of this branch. My clients require someone who has the 'knack' for Coordinating and can manage their time well and the pressures of the job, as it can get rather hectic Candidates are required to be friendly, outgoing, and caring. This role provides an excellent opportunity to work as part of a growing care organisation with a great reputation nationally. This established care company is proud of its longestablished reputation, and it’s staff ethos of working as a team. You will be rostering using IT allocation systems such as Staff Plan, for which training will be provided, but if you have experience of using rostering systems before it would be highly advantageous. You will be allocating hours to carers and liaising with Social Services, but in addition you will be carrying out occasional initial assessments and spot checks on carers, participating in the oncall rota, taking a lead on any disciplinary procedures, and overseeing the provision of highquality care to clients in their own homes. Applicants for this role must and possess a 'can do' attitude and be motivated to succeed. This role is permanent.
