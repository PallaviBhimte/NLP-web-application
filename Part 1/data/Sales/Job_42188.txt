Description: Sales Engineer – Automation Systems Worcester Circa **** per annum plus bonus. The company design, manufacture and commission special purpose test systems specifically to a customer’s requirements. Working with high profile automotive clients such as Aston Martin, Bentley and Ford their focus is on exceeding client’s expectations when providing a bespoke solution. This role has been created to build upon current success and to focus on new business generation. If you enjoy opening new markets and new clients please read on. Whilst the existing client list is predominantly automotive the engineering skills in control and automation can apply to other industry sectors such as chemical, food, pharmaceutical and it’s your ability to identify opportunities and client’s needs that are important. As there is no product range as such to sell, you will have to discuss technical requirements with some confidence and credibility, the engineering team is available to call in at the appropriate time but it must be stressed that without a technical background in a similar industry you are unlikely to fit the bill. Geographically you can use your business generation skills within the UK, mainland Europe and further afield if there is a good lead that can result in decent business you will not be restricted in pursuing this. This is a consultative, solution selling process where lead times can be months rather than weeks, we are looking for someone who can develop a sales strategy for the medium and long game. The rewards are there for success with a healthy bonus package over and above the base salary. Please apply with a CV detailing your sales expertise to Peter Starkiss.
