Webindex: 46629072
Description: Maricare Limited is looking for an experienced, proactive, forward thinking RMN to lead a friendly, well trained, supportive team through the transition from a Residential Care Home to a Registered Nursing Home and to oversee the registration process to ensure the outcomes required for registration by CQC are met. You will take the lead in using progressive methods that respond to distressed residents in a nonthreatening manner and which demonstrate understanding of the source of distress. You will be expected to provide evidence based individual therapy that encourages residents to take part in occupational therapy and promotes a “recovery” based approach to care. You will be expected to work with carers in educating them about the resident’s mental health and to help them to develop care plans and risk assessments and apply deescalation techniques enabling them to control emotions and behaviour.
