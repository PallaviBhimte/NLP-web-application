Description: My client is arguably the best company to join in order to work in the desirable high net worth space. My client is looking for a commercially mature, adept person to take on a relatively senior position within a tightknit, well established, marketleading team. It will work on non US high net worth clients, Subsequently, those with SME / Personal lines experience will be considered as will those from a London market background. The client is ideally looking for a senior actuarial resource and around the senior student or newly qualified career level. You will be able to forge, manage, and maintain close working relationships with Underwriters and also manage and mentor junior analysts within the team. Initially this will be for two analysts though this is likely to increase over a short period of time (less than one year). The role reports into the Head of Pricing, who in turn, reports into the CUO. The opportunity is extremely frontend, and very visible to senior business leaders. The incumbent of the role must therefore be comfortable working with this level of visibility, and should also be an assured communicator in order to work closely with those people in charge of driving the growth of this business unit. The role will ultimately lead into a team management position, though the softer skills will be taught,. Right now we just need people that are technically string from a pricing and relationship development perspective. Call me for an informal chat if you re interested in finding out more
