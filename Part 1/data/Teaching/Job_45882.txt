Company: Durham University
Description: Applications are invited for an ESRCfunded, ****month fulltime Postgraduate Research Associate position, to start 1st April ****3. The postholder will measure and compare the psychological styles of British Bangladeshi and White British residents of East London. Prospective applicants should have an undergraduate degree in Psychology, Anthropology or a related discipline (2.1 or above). The aim of the project is to compare the thinking and reasoning styles of people from different immigrant communities, to identify the reasons why immigrants do (or do not) shift from their heritage psychological styles to those of their local society. This post will address this question in the large British Bangladeshi community of East London, by administering a range of questionnaires and pencilandpaper tests to first and second generation British Bangladeshi residents, as well as White British comparison groups. The postholder will be jointly supervised by Dr Mesoudi (Durham University) and Dr Devyani Sharma, Prof Parvati Nair and Prof Peter McOwan (Queen Mary University of London), and may be based in East London. They will locate and recruit participants from the local East London area, administer questionnaires and tests following relevant ethical guidelines, and store and enter the data electronically. Links to the East London British Bangladeshi community, and fluency in Bengali, would be beneficial. The postholder will acquire key skills and knowledge in the study of crosscultural psychology, and potentially coauthor any resulting publication(s). This post would be ideal preparation for a PhD or Masters degree, if not already obtained.
