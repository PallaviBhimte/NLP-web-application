Description: We are working with a full service integrated agency that is going through an exciting period of new business wins. They offer full service digital and currently have a strong digital team in place. Currently looking to increase their offering they are really investing into digital with educational programmes and an increased spend on research and development. We are looking for a producer to sit on a new account amongst others. This is an exciting opportunity as they are looking for this person to implement process and really be a part of the growth of this account, educating the client and managing the initial stage of the handover. Workload is going to be online comms/ campaigns, however pipeline will be larger more technical builds and the producer will be really involved with every project from initial stages, working in this team will provide a good opportunity to learn from more senior digital people. We are looking for someone with a creative lean that is ready to establish themselves within a busy environment. We are looking for an individual that is process driven, client facing and will be able to become a part of the education process of non digital people within the agency. That said digital is really at the core of their offering. Experience: Online comms/ advertising background Mobile/ design and build (either preferable) Process driven Creative lean
