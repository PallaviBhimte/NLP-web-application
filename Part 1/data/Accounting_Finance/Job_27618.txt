Company: The Oakland Partnership
Description: INTERNAL SALES OPPORTUNITY – ASSET FINANCE Basic **** realistic OTE **** Buckinghamshire Our Client is an established and successful Leasing Brokerage that specialise in arranging finance for businesses acquiring IT/office technology equipment. They are looking to add another two members of staff to their small team due to outstanding results over the last 12 months. Your primary responsibility will be to proactively contact IT resellers to explain the benefits of using leasing as a ‘salesaid’ tool and ensuring that these resellers use this organisation to arrange the finance. This will involve building strong relationships over the telephone and it is therefore essential that you are a confident and articulate communicator with proven sales experience. Some of these resellers will have used this brokerage in the past but some will be new clients and it is therefore essential that you are comfortable with a coldcall element to your role. There is fantastic scope to progress within this position and it is envisaged that over time the position will evolve to allow you to visit resellers and build strong business relationships in person. To be considered for this position, you must be able to demonstrate at least 6 months telesales/appointment setting experience, preferably within the financial services sector. Regrettably, we will not be able to consider candidates in the event that the CV does not demonstrate the required experience.
