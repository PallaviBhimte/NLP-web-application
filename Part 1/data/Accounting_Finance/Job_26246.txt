Description: Essential skills: Demonstrable experience of working within an energy trading organisation within a front office department working closely with power and gas traders; experience working on and supporting a range of ETRM systems such as Solarc, Triplepoint, Aligne, Openlink etc; technical support expertise in SQL, Windows and / or Linux. Desirable experience: knowledge of the physical oil trading world; degree educated in a computer science or maths based subject. The role will sit within a power and gas trading function and will support all the technical and business needs of a dynamic and entrepreneurial trading team. The role could mentor and manage some more junior application support team members, however my client will also consider more junior members who are not ready to team lead in their careers. Due to the tight nature of the team, all members will be required to carry out all levels of support from level one to three. There will be a shift rota in place to support the London and Geneva businesses however overnight support will be handed over to US and Singapore support based functions. Day to day the role will support the users across a number of ETRM systems liaising with business users and developing strong relationships with front office users. You will identify, present and propose areas and processes for improvement. In short you will have sole responsibility for the support of the application environment during trading hours. The role will solely focus on the Power and Gas team with a separate physical oil team working close by. Therefore any knowledge of Oil Trading would be highly beneficial so cross training and use of staff within the two teams can happen.
