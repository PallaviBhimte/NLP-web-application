Description: Our client, recognized as one of the UK's market leaders in the area of automated materials handling solutions, is looking to recruit an enthusiastic and experienced mechanically biased Senior Project Engineer to complement their established and successful team. The successful candidate will work from a range of contract specifications whilst coordinating and supporting the activities of fellow members of the Project Team, liaising with suppliers and customers in order to develop efficient cost effective project layouts and detailed specifications and designs using AUTOCAD, and supporting all engineering aspects of the implementation of the solution whilst paying close attention to the project program, associated costings and contractual testing obligations. Reporting to the Project Engineering Team Leader, you will review presales concepts and overall system solutions and verify that these can be engineered to meet specific client requirements, whilst providing Project Engineering estimates, programmes and advice on safety and design detail, so proven previous mechanical design and project management experience are essential for the role. You will be qualified to HND / Degree level in Mechanical Engineering (or a relevant equivalent), and will prepare post sales overall general arrangement and subsystem arrangement drawings in order to ensure that the required design intent is translated into the engineered solution and meet statutory and customer specific requirements whilst eliminating safety hazards, and will coordinate activities to ensure that the related PLC functionality satisfies the solution whilst integrating all associated MHE elements. Additionally you will ensure that both constructability and maintainability are considered throughout the design phase, and will value engineer the overall solution for maximum project margins, before preparing associated installation documentation for the site construction teams and end users to ensure correct operation and maintenance of equipment. On occasions you will also be tasked with the creation of invitationtotender documentation and the preparation of project test scripts for customer acceptance testing, so excellent written and verbal communication skills are a prerequisite for the position, as is a valid driving licence as occasional customer site visits will be required. This is an excellent opportunity for a mechanically qualified project professional to develop their career within a stable and progressive renowned environment.
