Description: A large international manufacturing business based on the outskirts of Sheffield is currently looking to recruit a Senior Accountant to join their team and take responsibility for a newly formed company within their group. The role will require the successful applicant to work alongside the Finance Director in improving processes and controls whilst taking full ownership of the monthly management and year end accounts of the new entity. My client is ideally looking for a CIMA/ACA/ACCA qualified accountant who has a dynamic and proactive approach to their work. The new business unit will require immediate process and systems development so will require a confident and knowledgeable individual capable of hitting the ground running in the position.
