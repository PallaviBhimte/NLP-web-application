Description: We are currently working on behalf of a Top 10 practice to find an Audit Senior for one of the best Insurance teams in London. In order to be considered you will be ACA/CA or ACCA qualified and have three years experience in audit in practice, ideally in insurance, although this is an opportunity for newly qualified auditors to move across to insurance should you not already be a specialist. You should be experienced reporting under both UK GAAP and/or IFRS; be able to prepare accounts; and it would be beneficial for you to demonstrate a good base knowledge of corporation tax, VAT, PAYE, company secretarial procedures and software applications. This is a fantastic opportunity to build upon your experience to date in insurance, should you already specialise in the sector, or move across to an extremely interesting sector should you not be a specialist at this time. The role will offer a broad range of responsibilities in a growing team.
