Description: AHRC Research Grant, Oct 2013Sep 2016 A collaborative project between the Dept of Classics and Ancient History, University of Warwick (led by Dr Alison Cooley as Principal Investigator), the Ashmolean Museum (CoInvestigator Dr Susan Walker) and the Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents, University of Oxford (CoInvestigator, Dr Charles Crowther). Project Summary The project offers the opportunity for a PhD student to explore the wider significance of the museum's holdings of Latin inscriptions from Britain, and to explore the nature of Latin literacy and epigraphy in Britain from Roman through late antiquity and into mediaeval times. The PhD topic will be of interest to scholars concerned with the uses of literacy in the ancient and mediaeval worlds, the transition to and nature of society and culture in postRoman Britain, and the relationship between language and power. This piece of work will create bridges between ancient historians and mediaevalists, and generate dialogue between these disciplines which more normally remain separate.
