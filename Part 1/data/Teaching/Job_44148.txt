Description: Science Teacher: A fantastic high achieving school located in the heart of central London is looking to appoint a science teacher from as soon as possible on a full time, permanent basis. The school performs well in terms of academic achievement (over 90% AC grades at GCSE last year) and pupil behaviour at the school tends to be excellent. The school consistently receives 'outstanding' Ofsted reports and the science department is well facilitated and the Head of science is experienced, approachable and supportive. The successful science teacher will be expected to teach science at KS**** to GCSE standard. An ALevel Biology, Chemistry or Physics timetable may be available to a suitably qualified and experienced science teacher but teaching to ALevel standard is not a requirement for applying to this role. The school is happy to accept applications from newly qualified science teachers as well as from science teachers with more experience. Overseas trained science teachers are also welcome to apply. All science teacher applicants should have Qualified Teachers Status or the NARIC recognised equivalent.
