Company: MTS 
Description: MTS are an independent specialist technical and engineering recruitment agency. We specialize in the supply of temporary and permanent workers to a wide range of niche industry sectors including; Aerospace, Broadcast, Electronics, Automotive and Manufacturing. Following a successful 2012 where we experienced high levels of growth in particular within our Engineering Team we are now looking to expand that team. We are looking for a Junior Recruitment Consultant looking for their first or second role within the industry who we can train and develop to become an integral part of the company. Ideally you will have experience of working in a sales/telesales environment working to daily/weekly targets and KPIâ€™s, possess the ability to develop relationships from initial contact through to valued client, be able to work in a small team and sometimes pressurised environment. This is not an easy role and although some clients will be passed to you it will not suit a Recruitment Consultant looking for an Account Management role. We will offer full training and support with the potential to earn more than the industry standard. In return we ask for a dedicated team member willing to commit to the company and be part of the development of the Engineering Team and MTS as a company.
