Description: The Leather Bottle is a classic old village inn, with a beautiful old tiled roof sheltering mellow Hampshire brick. Inside you'll find comfortable, relaxed surroundings and a warm, friendly atmosphere. Our menu has a spine of freshly prepared, classic British dishes, complemented by more exotic influences from other parts of the world: in other words, modern British cookery. Our passion lies in finding quality ingredients and preparing, cooking and presenting them in a modern but unpretentious way. We’re looking for an ambitious and committed chef with a passion for food who is ready to take the next step in his or her career. For us it’s all about serving fresh, simple, high quality traditional dishes extremely well. This is a busy working environment, and as well as having high standards and demonstrating good attention to detail, you’ll help the crew set the bar high in terms of delicious dishes, effective kitchen controls and excellent standards of health and hygiene. We see our CDP’s as being on the first step of the ladder to a senior chef role and we’ll provide support and development opportunities for you along the way. We have a website at www.leatherbottle.hcpr.co.uk but it’s also worth having a good look through the Brunning and Price website at www.brunningandprice.co.uk to get a feel of where we're heading .
