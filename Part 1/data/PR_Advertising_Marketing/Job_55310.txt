Company: MEDIA CONTACTS
Description: Are you degree educated and looking to kickstart your career? Do you have at least 6 months selling to businesses experience behind you? Are you articulate and businessminded? Then get in touch with me I am currently working with a highly regarded international events company. It is looking for an exceptional person to join its team. You will sell sponsorship on its established events but will need to convince the client to book before you have an event to sell on  so being knowledgeable of the market and understanding your clients is essential. You will be able to sell intelligently to senior level people, confident and able to represent the company when meeting big clients  so being perfectly presented is a must. The role is phone based with the occasional meeting or networking at the events required. This role would suit an ambitious individual who would enjoy working in a young, dynamic office who has a view to grow their own events and someone who can think creatively. Please note you must be degree educated (****:**** or equivalent) to be considered for this position. If this sounds like you then contact Hannah Coleman immediately.
