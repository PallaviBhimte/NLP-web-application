Description: Blue Skies are looking to add to their Account Handling division and are keen to hear from Account Handlers looking for a new challenge. Established in 1998, Blue Skies has built an enviable reputation within the agency space. Working with creative shops of all sizes (from global networks to start ups), we have always been driven by our commitment to client/candidate service. Following a hugely successful year, we are looking to add to our Account Handling division.
