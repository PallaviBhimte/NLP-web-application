Description: Live in Care jobs for older clients (various work patterns). Make a difference to an older persons life. Salary ******** per day The Good Care Group is founded on the principle that elderly people want to live the best possible lives. Age and illness can make that difficult to achieve. We believe it can be done and it is easier to achieve if people remain living in their own homes with the help of a first class “LiveIn Carer”. We will be leading the market place in providing excellence in all that we do. If you are a compassionate, caring, cheerful and reliable person willing to give our clients the respect, dignity and support they deserve then we would like to hear from you. We will reward you with a premium salary, bonuses and incentives for performance and development and uniquely we offer shares in the business to all our Carers as part of our commitment to an exclusive long term relationship with you. We will develop you through our excellent free training programme which will include first aid, food hygiene, medications training, communication skills, cooking and supporting specialist conditions such as dementia and Parkinson’s disease. Our programme will also help you to achieve an NVQ qualification. We will value you. Being a Carer with us will be a fulfilling stimulating role that makes a substantial difference to our clients' lives. You are vital to our success, and we recognise that in the way we employ you directly, train and reward you; we are not an agency. If you are interested in joining our exciting company and are interested in working either a 4 day week or **** week on and 1 weeks off or 4 days on and 4 days off (or various other work patterns), please apply today.
