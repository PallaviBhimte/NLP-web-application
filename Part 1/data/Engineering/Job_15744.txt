Webindex: 67784918
Company: Judd Farris Property Recruitment
Description: A leading planning and development consultancy are currently recruiting for a Real Estate Economist or Economic Planner to join their rapidly growing team. You will be joining a National Research team whose workload focuses on the social and economic research that underpins planning applications. Currently the team is weighted more towards planners and they are looking to rebalance by bringing in someone with a stronger Economics background. The role will entail liaising with external clients to produce Economic Impact Assessments, Economic Viability Appraisals and other related documentation to support planning applications for a wide variety of property types. Current projects include large mixeduse schemes, a town centre regeneration project as well as some more esoteric work such as windfarms and minerals projects. Due to the fact that this is a rapidly growing and fairly young team there is a real opportunity for the person who comes in to this role to have a leading hand in shaping the future direction and development of the department. In terms of background they are fairly open, the right person could come from a variety of backgrounds including Development Surveyor, Planner, Property Research or Economist. The key thing is strong technical analysis skills as well as a passion for Real Estate. For further information and to apply please email allan.applebeejuddfarris.co.uk or call **** **** ****
