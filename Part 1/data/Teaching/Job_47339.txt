Company: RP CUSHING
Description: RPCushing are working in partnership with this leading media agency looking to recruit some data analysts into a newly formed team. This new team will aim to support client teams with research, insight and analysis gathered from classical sources, new and emerging online sources and untapped market research sources. These analysts will support all internal insight professionals in helping them become more detailed in the research, broader and more inspiring. The successful candidate will come from a research background with a heavy analytical leaning, someone who has demonstrable knowledge of heavy quantitative research techniques but takes things over and above the standard, who loves to get to the heart of the data and then present it back to clients in a innovative and informative manner. My clients are open on packages used but these could include: SPSS, Excel, Python, Google Refine. This is an excellent opportunity to join a company with a fantastic reputation.
