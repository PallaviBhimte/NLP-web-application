Company: Genesis Associates  Limited
Description: We are a recruitment company based in Wilmslow, Cheshire that supplies Sales and Engineering professionals to companies across the UK. We currently employ **** consultants our new office will give us growth plans to **** over the next 12 months so right now, we are looking to hire **** outstanding people to join us on our growth journey. We are holding an open day at the start of February, we are looking for ambitious, hardworking individuals that want to work in sales. But before you email, ask yourself is this a good use of my time? **** reasons why this job probably isnt for you 1.You dont like change We operate an environment of continuous improvement; we will always challenge the status quo and love people that ask how can we do this better? A structured career development program including reviews, quarterly personal development plans enables you to advance quickly. 2.You prefer to work anonymously within a team We each have our own client base, key accounts and communities that we personally manage. We like people who are not afraid to stand up and be counted for, and push themselves out of comfort zones to try new things and who can work autonomously or within a project team. ****You dont like competition Just like the Olympics did for Britain, we strive to be the best and that means working alongside and competing with the best in industry. We organise international competitions and incentives (Vegas, Palma), quarterly awards, weekends away and other exciting events. We love competition ****You would rather everyone received the same rewards regardless of individual contribution Competitive basic wages ****k****k, one of the best commission schemes in industry, our top earners take home **** each year. ****You dont like vibrant, noisy sales environments We are a noisy telephone based business, whether taking a new customers job order, qualifying a candidates suitability, negotiating contracts, or confirming job offers etc .chances are you will be on the phone and so will everyone around you. Laughter and having fun is a key part of our culture so if you take yourself very seriously, you dont like banter, we may not be the business for you. ****Influencing people is not a strength of yours Are you someone that people seek advice from? Can you make others see your point of view? If you didnt get the present you wanted for xmas maybe you didnt drop enough hints, and you may not have the persuasive skills needed for recruitment ****You lack an attention to detail. Good use of language is massively important, from writing job ads, to preparing newsletters or simply advising on improving CVs. If you havent spoted these delibirate spelling mistakes, you probly wont be much help advizing people on how to improve their CV You dont have to be a wordsmith, knowing how to use spell check is just as important ****You think targets are not necessary, you will just do you best Measuring performance and analysing where to improve is good business. Look at the impact on the sky cycling team or British Olympic team, the science of marginal gains is powerful stuff. ****You dont want to be trained; you would rather just figure things out Genesis offer an intensive **** month Recruitment Development Programme that is designed to fast track the right people. With a full time training manager guiding your progress, if you prefer to just amble along at your own pace, then this will not be for you. ****You are more concerned about what s good for you and not your clients Recruitment will start with new business, but ultimately its about managing key accounts and giving your clients the best service. If going the extra mile is not you, then managing major accounts will be almost impossible. If you would like to know more about careers with Genesis send us your CV and covering letter. New applications are being reviewed on 11th February, so please ensure you contact us before then.
