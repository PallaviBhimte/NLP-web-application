Description: Recruiting a demi chef de partie for an award winning and renowned rosette standard restaurant within a grand hotel in the Berkshire countryside  but less than half hour from the M25. As demi chef de partie you must be aware of the role a chef de partie takes, looking after a section, overseeing commis chefs and contributing to other chef s needs  because naturally the idea is you would be working towards a chef de partie position within the restaurant. This role of demi chef de partie is definitely not an easy one to take on, and could possibly be the hardest job you would have to date. Not because the chef is particularly hard on any of his staff, but the quality of food is so high I would envisage you being harder on yourself than anyone else is within the talented and progressive brigade. The restaurant itself is set in a fantastic Hotel just off the River Thames with exceptional facilities and a reputation that would set you amongst the greats if you stay within the brigade for any length of time. Chef is not looking for someone to pass through on their way to their next position. Chef has an amazing talent for cooking and is the type of man that will pass on his knowledge, because at the end of the day  no matter how amazing the chef is, the restaurant is only as good as the team. For this reason, any demi chef de partie that works for him will end up with such a honed set of skills, the work is worth that alone, never mind the **** salary.
