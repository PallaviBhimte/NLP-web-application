Description: I am recruiting for a Senior Treasury Dealer to join this established treasury team in the Berkshire area. The primary responsibility of the role will be to manage the groupâ€™s liquidity and to manage relationships with banking counterparties. This is a great opportunity for a Treasury Dealer with a solid grounding in dealing FX and IRS to make the stepup to a senior position. You will be responsible for compiling reports around cash, FX and IR risk for senior management and will be comfortable in dealing with senior stakeholders and external contacts with banks, rating agencies, consultants etc. The AMCT qualification would be nice to have but is not a prerequisite for this role.
