Description: We currently have an urgent requirement for a Transaction Reporting Specialist to join the Compliance department of a global invest bank on an ongoing temporary basis. You will be solely responsible for all aspects of FSA transaction reporting, from a BAU and project perspective. Daily duties will include providing crossproduct transaction reporting, with a particular focus on fixed income products, and resolving any reporting queries from internal and external clients. You will be required to liaise extensively with Operations to obtain relevant information for submissions and maintain relationships with the necessary regulatory bodies. A large part of the role will be projectbased and will involve UAT testing of transaction reporting applications. In order to be considered for this role, you must be a transaction reporting expert, as you will be the goto person for both internal and external counterparties, and you must have gained this experience within an investment banking background. A detailed knowledge of fixed income products is essential and previous project exposure will be highly beneficial. This is an excellent opportunity to broaden your current experience, working in a standalone capacity within a highly regarded organisation, in a role that offers longterm potential at a competitive rate.
