Description: We are working with a PRU in Chatham that caters for **** students and an additional **** students accessing ****:**** tuition service. The overall objective of the PRU is to facilitate opportunities for reintegration and inclusion in mainstream schools or other suitable educational provision or providing quality alternative provision which meets the needs of each individual. All pupils have behavioural, emotional or social difficulties and some also have significant learning difficulties. Many have been permanently excluded from mainstream schools whilst others have been identified as being at risk of permanent exclusion. This is an exciting time of change and progression for the school and they have a number of excellent opportunities. They require and experience teaching assistant to join their team until the end of the academic year when they will be offered the chance to interview for a permanent job. It is essential that you have some experience with EBD and that you have worked in KS**** and/or **** before. For more details please contact us ASAP.
