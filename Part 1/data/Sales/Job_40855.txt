Company: AMR   West Midlands
Description: One of the areas most well known and respected estate agents are looking to recruit a high calibre senior branch manager / estate agent for their prestigious Solihull office. This is an office which has traditionally blown every target out of the water, achieved exceptional fee levels and been head and shoulders above local competition. At present it is not performing any where near its full potential and now requires a senior branch manager to return it to the top of the pecking order. This is a great opportunity for someone to really make a name for themselves in a firm that rewards hard work and endeavour. A generous salary package and commission package are available. This is not for the faint hearted. If you feel you have what it takes call Chris Oliver This job was originally posted as www.totaljobs.com/JobSeeking/BranchManagerEstateAgent_job****
