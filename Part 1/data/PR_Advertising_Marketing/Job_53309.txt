Title: Business Development Manager  Sponsorship Sales
Webindex: 68540424
Company: MEDIA CONTACTS
Description: Highly respected international events organisation seeks high achieving sales professional to join its dedicated sponsorship team. You will work in the way of selling sponsorship before production of the event is started so you will genuinely learn whether the market will support the idea. You will not work from a programme or be given a list of hot leads so will therefore need to use your own initiative to source your own data. Working on a portfolio of businesstobusiness conferences across major areas of industry, you will be responsible for selling high value sponsorship packages to senior decision makers at blue chip organisations. Our client is renowned for the quality of its training and therefore very much offers a career move, as they will help you to become one of the very best sponsorship sales people in the business. Earning potential is extremely good and could see you double or nearly triple your basic. Candidates must be degree educated (2:**** or equivalent), articulate with proven success in previous roles. Sponsorship sales experience would certainly be preferred, but other professional, B2B environments with complex, long sales cycles would also be considered. This role would suit a young, ambitious individual who is presentable, a quick learner, able to write well and be proactive, and who has an appetite to excel in their role. The right candidate will get the chance to grow their own events, move onto bigger ones when a position opens, possibly even conference production or the chance to move to an oversees office if this is something they want.
