Title: CMS (Q****) content upload
Webindex: 70229149
Description: We have six brand sites to be updated between January and March this year. There is an existing website up and running already for one brand, which will be copied (almost exactly across all brands) with different copy and images. The copy is almost identical in content and length (but with brand TOV adjustments). We need some one to come in and drop in all copy and images into all **** new sites (and time estimate how long this will take). There will then be a short period where brands approve layout etc., then there will probably be another week needed to make amends in March. Ideal experience  CQ**** experience or at least web publishing. Based with Client at Milton Keynes, but candidate will need to say they are working on behalf of us.
