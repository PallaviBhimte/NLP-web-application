Webindex: 71741011
Company: Brunning and Price
Description: Chefs de Partie – salary **** to **** The Bulls Head (presently Osteria Mauro) will, come the New Year, be the latest addition to the Brunning and Price family of classic pub restaurants, which includes, amongst others, The Wharf in Castlefield, Little Manor in Thelwall and Sutton Hall in Macclesfield. We’re proud to be recognised by the Good Pub Guide as Pub Group Of The Year 2013 and we plan to continue our recipe for success at the Bulls Head. We’re planning an extensive refurbishment to take the building back to a classic country pub (including a new state of the art kitchen) and upon completion you’ll find cosy dining areas and alcoves with open fires, bookcases and lots of old wood furniture leading into a light and airy garden room. We’re also planning to build a large raised deck at first floor level as well as a sunny terrace to provide an outside drinking and eating area for when the weather is fine. The bar will be at the heart of the building with six cask ales on tap, a back shelf crammed with Malts and an extensive wine list. Our menus will have a spine of freshly prepared, classic British dishes, complemented by more exotic influences from other parts of the world – in other words, modern British cookery. We plan to reopen in Spring 2013 and we are looking for experienced Chefs de Partie who will help set the highest standards of food quality and consistency. This is a busy working environment, and as well as having high standards and demonstrating good attention to detail, you’ll help the crew set the bar high in terms of cooking delicious dishes, maintaining effective kitchen controls and adhering to excellent standards of health and hygiene. The potential here is enormous and we’re looking for ambitious and committed chefs with a passion for good food who are ready to take the next step in their career. We provide all our chefs with real opportunities to develop with us into a senior chef role with training and support in place for you along the way. Depending on your experience, we’ll reward you with a salary from **** to **** and you’ll be part of a successful, growing company who have been awarded Pub Group of the Year on five occasions.
