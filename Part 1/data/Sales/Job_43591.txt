Webindex: 72240027
Company: The Edge
Description: Field Based Account Manager/Sales Consultant Territory: Kingston Leatherhead (Surrey) Package of basic salary (circa ****), car and genuinely uncapped OTE ****k minimum earnings year one, plus company benefits Are you an experienced field based sales professional residing within the Kingston upon Thames or Leatherhead or nearby/surrounding area? Are you keen to join a national market leader who can provide not only genuinely high level uncapped earnings but true career progression opportunities? If so, then please read onâ€¦ This UK marketleader in washroom services provision currently seeks to appoint a motivated sales person to cover the Kingston Leatherhead area. Specific sector sales experience is NOT at all required, but in order to apply you will certainly require a solid track record in field based B2B sales, preferably having had strong focus on the SME market and be accustomed to selling a 'full service' contract sell (signing up businesses to **** **** or **** year contracts). Please note that applications from washroom sales experienced professionals with a genuinely credible trackrecord and employment history are welcomed. Whilst you will have a large portfolio of existing clients to upsell and develop, there is also a significant newbusiness target, so you must also be accustomed to some own lead generation, coldcalling and prospecting in order to build your pipeline and secure new clients. Please note the 'split' on account development and puerile new business will be very well balanced at around ****/50%. In order to succeed and progress within this role, you will therefore need to be well organized (the ability to work 'smart' and plan your days effectively) as well as having first rate sales and influencing skills. You will also be able to demonstrate at interview with ease to our client that you have a strong track record of sales results within a similar sales role. Please note that it is essential that applicants reside 'on patch' so please only apply if you reside within the KT, GU or TW postcode areas. Interviews are expected to be held at a fairly local location within the coming fortnight; this with a view to a fairly swift appointment being made once the successful candidate has been identified. So if this sounds like the next exciting step in your professional sales career, please apply with an up to date CV today. Please note that due to large volumes of applicants at present, only those successfully short listed will be contacted by Edge Recruits within **** hours, so if you have not been contacted please presume you have been unsuccessful this time.
