Description: Year **** Booster Teacher Waltham Forest Location Lovely **** form entry primary school Immediate start Post to run at least until SATs Are you an experienced Key Stage **** teacher looking for a role where you can have an immediate impact? A well run 2 form entry primary school are on the lookout for a teacher with a proven track record in Key Stage 2 that can join them as soon as possible and work with small groups of Year **** pupils in the run up to SATs. This is a great position and could really suit someone that is looking to get back into school after maternity leave or someone that is doing supply but wants a bit more stability. You would be working with groups no larger than **** and really focussing on numeracy and literacy where you will need to make progress quickly. They are a bright bunch of pupils but the Headteacher really wants to ensure that they reach their full potential. If you are up for the challenge then we need to hear from you now. The school are hoping to interview as soon as possible and the post can start straight away so do not delay
