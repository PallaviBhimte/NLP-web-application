Description: Senior Sous Chef for **** rosette kitchen, up to ****6000 My client has a very well maintained kitchen, awarded ****AA rosettes serving fine food with a classical style using modern techniques in a **** red star hotel. The Head Chef is a very talented individual who runs a tight ship that needs another leader to join the ranks. As Senior Sous you would need to have the ability to deputise in the Head Chefs absence and ensure the quality of the kitchen does not falter. For this you would ideally have a background in ****AA rosette cooking, or be a very strong and talented chef with 2AA rosette experience. There is a live in opportunity available for very little cost, meaning no matter where you are in the UK there is nothing stopping you from making that next step in your career and working somewhere nationally recognised and acclaimed. In the top 50 Hotels in the UK, this Senior Sous Chef position is a real responsibility, so I am only looking for the strongest of candidates with a natural leadership, but still happy to take orders and learn from a senior chef. If you are serious about your food, love classical British menus with a modern twist and have what it takes to work alongside the best, creating the best then email to apply and get that job you've dreamt of for so long.
