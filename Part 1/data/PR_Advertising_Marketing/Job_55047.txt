Description: A great Digital agency based in London are looking for a PPC Client Manager to join their successful Search team. The role is not highly technical but more creative with a huge emphasis on client relationships. They will invest heavily in this person and you will be in charge of your own future. Essentially they are looking for someone fairly junior but with bags of enthusiasm, drive and ability. Their not worried about whether they have any prior experience in an agency or not, but they must be presentable and very articulate . It would be a great role for a new grad itching to get into this sector that has worked on their own little projects at University. In terms of the skillset required, this is a dual role; initially largely PPC focussed no experience required, but then increasingly learning and using website analytics to recommend changes to client's websites. Excellent English skills are a must, creative or technical capabilities in the fields of graphic design or web design are a nicetohave. It's not a role for a pure web developer/designer though. The Job The role initially will be one of supporting the PPC Team and Search Manager with client work in key PPC campaigns. Initially, lots of campaign design and analysis but progressing quickly. Within 36 months you should be able to attend client meetings and within 12 months you should be owning and leading client relationships. They will set time aside each week to train them on PPC and web analytics personally. There is real potential to learn a lot in a short space and become a competent online marketer within a year, only for a focussed individual.
