Supporting over **** users you will ideally have experience of implementing Citrix XenDesktop in a large environment, the majority of the work is project based and will involved very little BAU. Any additional experience with SAN (EMC is in place but my client is not vendor specific) will be of great benefit to your application, though not absolutely necessary. Due to the volume of applications received for positions it will not be possible to respond to all applications and only applicants who are considered suitable for interview will be contacted.
