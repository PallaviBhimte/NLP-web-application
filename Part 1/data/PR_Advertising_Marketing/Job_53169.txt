Webindex: 68215048
Company: Media Contacts
Description: One of the UK's most up and coming healthcare communications groups seeks an account director to join its PR division. This is an agency small enough that it has a family feel and everyone gets a good mix of client work as well as involved in the running of the team, but with solid, big company backing. They're looking for a healthcare PR account director hot on building and maintaining relationships with senior members of pharmaceutical companies and with high profile PR experience from a healthcare communications business. Responsibilities will include managing and mentoring your team of account handlers, working closely with key clients on major communications assignments as well as the day to day activities you would expect at account director, such as standing in for the directors when necessary. It goes without saying you'll be a strong communicator, great with people and full of ideas. This vacancy would suit a bright senior account manager looking for the next step up, or a relatively new account director wanting to fast track their career.
