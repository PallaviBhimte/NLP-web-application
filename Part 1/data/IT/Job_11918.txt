Company: Infinitium Recruitment
Description: For the purposes of SEO: Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Rails Rails Rails Rails RubyonRails RubyonRails RubyonRails RubyonRails Ruby on Rails Now that that's out the way, hope you are doing well. This is literally the best RoR team to work for in London. If I was a RoR dev i would want to work for these guys. They never work with contractors and previous to this they were only paying upto****k but because the market is like it is they realise that if they want to extend their **** strong backend RoR team any further with A devs they need to offer salaries which will temp people away from contracting. This is groundbreaking. I'm a pure RoR recruiter and this is the first time I have seen a genuine ****k salary. This is not a normal opportunity. Achieving the full ****k salary will mean a lot of preparation and proving that you are going to provide that level of value, but if you can do it you will effectively have all the benefits of a permant role in a VERY VERY desirable RoR team to work, but on contractor money. Best of both worlds situation. I've heard stories that in the past people had left for a higher salary then come back because they missed it there. Now you have the opportunity for the Salary and the awesome company I can help get you there with helping you write you CV to the highest standard and preparing you for every step of the interview so you can show yourself in the best possible light. Get in contact, **** **** **** or **** **** **** Skype/Gtalk/Email: LouisRoRgmail.com http://uk.linkedin.com/in/louisbeardsley Twitter LouisRoR They haven't given this role to other recruiters, its just with me plus I've got loads of Contract Perm roles at all the biggest and best teams so I'm your one stop shop when it comes to RoR recruitment whatever you're looking for.
