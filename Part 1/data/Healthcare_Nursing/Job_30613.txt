Description: Park Villa is a small, communitybased therapeutic unit that provides tailored, personal rehabilitation and recovery for people who use psychiatric services on a long term or intensive basis, including patients liable to detention under the Mental Health Act. At the forefront of care and support at Park Villa is the promotion of independence and social inclusion for all our patients, who typically present with behaviours that challenge mainstream support services. Our care and support are provided by the services of a consultant psychiatrist, a psychotherapist, mental health nurses, an occupational therapist and experienced support staff. Our nursing and support staff are on duty 24 hours a day. We are looking to increase our RMN Bank Team to establish effective therapeutic relationships with patients, their families and carers.
