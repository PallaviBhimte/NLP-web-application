Description: Dynamic Market Research Executive Award Winning Agency **** This is a really great opportunity to join an award winning agency and use your previous market research agency experience in a dynamic team. We are looking for a bright, inquisitive, confident individual, with quantitative research background, who wants a role which will give them the opportunity to develop in several areas. Working on a combination of tracking and ad hoc studies this could be a great way to use the skills you have gained in a primary research role and be client facing. You will have had some experience in scripting, checking samples, amending questionnaires. Experience of working on ad hoc studies isn't essential although you would have had about 12 months research agency experience and be looking to join a company who will definitely give you the chance to learn and develop your skills in this area and work on a range of projects including NPD and ad pre and post testing.
