Webindex: 71434697
Company: Project Resource   London and South East England
Description: A leading civil engineering contractor currently has an opportunity for a Programme Planner/Project Coordinator on an initial six month basis, with the possibility of a longer term duration. Despite the company's engineering focus, our client is seeking an individual who has worked on programmes in a strategic environment (such as IT or defence sector) and can start as soon as possible. The role will be based in Feltham (West London) with occasional travel to the Isle of Wight. Our client is a national main contractor with offices across the country; recent project wins have meant that their infrastructure team has come under particular strain of late. They currently have an impressive portfolio of live projects across the South East (around **** in total) that need to be coordinated and managed centrally. The role will be based in the office and will involve making changes to programmes based on information received from sitebased project managers and providing updates, creating costings using information in excel and generally relieving the strain being placed on the Senior Programmer/Planner. However, the successful candidate must be prepared to travel to the Isle of Wight one day per week. This position will suit an individual with exposure to project planning/programming but who perhaps wishes to deviate into another sector. In order to be considered, our client is seeking the following:  Previous experience as a Planner/Programmer/Project Coordinator, ideally in a strategic environment such as IT, defence, etc.  Proficiency with MS Project 2010.  A valid driving licence and must live in a southern location that is able to get to Isle of Wight one day per week (maximum and worst case scenario).  Exposure to Sharepoint would be advantageous.  Positive individual with excellent attention to detail.  Eligible to work in the UK. In return, our client is offering a day rate of up to **** per day and a potential long term contract, although this depends on continuing workloads. Apply now for immediate consideration or call George Reeves on **** **** **** for further details. Services advertised by Project Resource are that of an employment business and/or agency.
