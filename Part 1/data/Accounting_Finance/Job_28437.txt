Company: Altima FD
Description: We are currently representing a recently funded, high growth outdoor sports manufacturing business. The company has created a niche within its space and is experiencing treble digit growth at present. We are looking to source a VP of Finance who can help the organisation through its growth and onto maturity and likely exit. The role will include dealing with the fact that the companyâ€™s revenues are derived from several regions, implementing robust controls and procedures to allow further growth and liaison with the VC fund involved. It would be ideal if you have been involved within a retail/ecommerce business and are used to dealing with businesses with external shareholders such as a VC fund.
