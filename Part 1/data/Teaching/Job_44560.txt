Company: University of Oxford
Description: Department of Oncology, Old Road Campus Research Building, Oxford Grade ****: ****  **** p.a. Applications are invited for a threeyear postdoctoral research position within the Telomeres and Genome Stability Group led by Dr Madalena Tarsounas at the Gray Institute in Oxford. We are looking for a highly motivated postdoc interested in joining our international team. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work on one of the open projects involving the identification and characterisation of novel regulators of senescence induced by DNA repair defects in mammalian cells. The primary goal of the Telomeres and Genome Stability Group is to investigate how factors involved in DNA repair by homologous recombination contribute to telomere maintenance and genome integrity. The successful candidate will aim to define at molecular level the tumorigenesis barriers active in the HRcompromised, Brca****deleted cells. We have recently characterised ****BP**** gene abrogation as a mechanism to silence checkpoints and circumvent cell cycle arrest in Brca****deficient MEFs (Bouwmann et al., NSMB ****010). We are currently undertaking smallscale shRNA screens for factors that can rescue the proliferative block in Brca2deleted cells. The project will be focused on validation and functional analysis of the isolated hits, as well as extending this screen to the whole mouse genome library. The successful candidate will have: a PhD/DPhil in Biology, Biochemistry or related subject a good publication record with a minimum of one firstauthor publication in peerreview journal, published or in press a high level of technical competence in standard cell and molecular biology techniques a background in senescence or DNA damage signalling/repair Experience in lentiviral/retroviral infection of mammalian cells and highthroughput screens is desirable. This is a fulltime post and is offered for three years. All applicants must complete a short online application form and upload a CV and supporting statement.
