We are looking for a creative and passionate communicator who is able to create a fully collaborative employee engagement experience. You will develop our strategy, then roll it out through creative communications campaigns underpinned by our key business goals and the findings from our latest employee survey. You will be a key cultural architect and a driving force behind our plans to transform the business through more efficient ways of working. Your IT skills will shine through in your role as the Intranet webmaster, while at the same time you will develop our approach to internal social media as a key collaboration tool.

The Employee Engagement Advisor role sits within a busy and wellestablished Communications Team. The nature of our work means that we need a flexible candidate with bags of ideas and enthusiasm who isn’t afraid to get stuck into any task we need to achieve. A perfect cultural match is vital to us, as is a can do attitude and a real passion for internal communications.
