Working within a fast paced manufacturing environment, the successful candidate will be responsible for all aspects of both planned preventative and reactive maintenance across a diverse range of both PLC controlled systems and single and 3 phase equipment as well as traditional mechanical equipment, and you will excel in all aspects of motor strip down and rebuild, pump stripping and repair on various other items of plant including presses, shotblasters, compressors, boilers and conveyors as well as automated systems, working on a permanent days basis (6am to 3pm with occasional earlier starts and weekend work when required) with regular overtime available. A team player equally comfortable in working autonomously, you will demonstrate exceptional communication skills, initiative and common sense as well as an analytical and innovative approach to problem solving and an excellent grasp of engineering concepts.

This role is not for the faint hearted, and you will thrive within a hands on environment in which your skills and abilities to react quickly to plant breakdowns, analyse faults and ensure plant is up and running again immediately will be challenged daily, and as the working environment is a dirty and more traditional heavy engineering one, those seeking a clean environment each day need not apply as you will inevitably be expected to undertake daily hands on repairs in order to keep production moving. A driving licence and own vehicle are also essential for the role. For a good all round hands on mechanically biased engineer with the ability to tackle any problem that they are faced with associated with pneumatic, hydraulic and electrical engineering, this is a genuinely exceptional opportunity to join an established and committed team offering stability and progression and an attractive remuneration package from the start.
