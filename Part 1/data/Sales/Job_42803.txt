Company: New Opportunities
Description: Are you open minded to the possibility that there is a way for you to have a better future? Would you like to work alongside, as an equal partner, a privately owned global corporation in an industry that will allow you to thrive rather than stay stuck in a job or a financially limited career that barely allows you to survive? Would you like to explore the option of having a business with no risk, high rewards and one which gives you full control over the outcome of your income? You may be successful in your career but want a change, or a entrepreneurial graduate looking to build a secure business, a parent looking for p/time flexible hours with a good income or you may, due to the unstable economy, be out of work  or perhaps as a professional in your chosen field you really want to enjoy a better work/life balance? This is an opportunity for you to have you own business within a dynamic global company with an impeccable track record, trading in over 150 countries worldwide. We are an 'Investor in People' accredited organisation at the Gold Champion Level status meaning we have a structured Training Development program in place to guarantee your success. Previous business experience is not necessary  as a global company we work with people from all different backgrounds, ages, cultures and experiences however we do have quite a standard for the people we look to partner with so you need to be very motivated, enthusiastic with a great learning attitude, have good communication skills and an absolute desire to improve or alter your current situation. Our success is built on the success of individuals just like yourself  so if you're serious about taking control of your finances and you feel you have what we are looking for then contact us now  you will get a call back and if after a brief initial chat we feel its appropriate we'll get the ball rolling with relevant information.
