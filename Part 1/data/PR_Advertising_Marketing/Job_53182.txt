Title: PR Account Executive/Account Manager
Webindex: 68215252
Company: AF Selection
Description: Exciting opportunity for either a PR Account Manager or Account Executive to join a hugely respected full service agency as they develop a new office in Cheltenham. Our client is a hugely respected integrated agency with a large existing PR team, but due to business wins and growth they are looking to expand to a second location. Initially this will mean you will be working very closely with one Associate Director on a daily basis, although you will of course have support and conversation with the existing teams, and that your role will be very varied. You really must be prepared to take an all hands on deck approach so whilst you ll probably experience a broader array of PR work than you would in a large team, you ll also need to be prepared for a bit of PR admin through to assisting with seeking out and pitching for new business. Clientwise, initially the focus will be quite consumer focussed (food, consumer durables) but in the long term they expect the roster to be quite broad, and given the breadth this agency already has you should be happy with diversity. This is a really exciting position, and the client is flexible to the level of person they would consider, but they do need someone who does have at least 6 months experience as an Account Executive within a consultancy environment at the more junior end, and with at least 3 years for the Manager level position. Given the nature of the role, a lot of the specifics have yet to be confirmed, but realistically we re looking for someone who wants to be on board for January or early February. This is a superb opportunity so please do send your CV for the immediate attention of Emma Tee to consultafselection.co.uk or call for an initial chat on **** ****
