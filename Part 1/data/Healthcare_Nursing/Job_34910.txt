Description: WE ARE LOOKING FOR GENUINE RELOCATORS ONLY.Here at Purely Healthcare we specialise in enabling our candidates to make big changes in their lifes. One of the ways we do this is with our special relocation packages, we understand that moving home and job all at the same time can be daunting so here's what we can do to help: Straight forward budget for the move  We can tell you how much each client of ours can put towards your relocation. Help getting to the interviews  We will try and set up a days worth of interviews and will help set up the travel, also we will refund the cost of attending the interviews for you so you are not out of pocket. Help with the move  When the big day comes we can help with the actual move, also we specialise in finding accomadation, schools, research into different areas in the county that you are moving too. often our candidates will stay overnight at 1st interview and view property on the next day.WHAT WE EXPECT FROM YOU.We want to be able to offer this fantastic service to all candidates. We can only do that by screening our candidates carefully, we do not offer this service to candidates who are 'just seeing what is out there.' The intial consultation with us over the phone should be a frank and honest discussion about excatly where is desirable with relocation and time frames. If an offer of employment is recieved and accepted bth PHCare and our clients would require a contract agreeing to work at least 12 months. the reason for this is because if we are paying out a big relocation package we have to know the candidate will start employment and stay a resonable amount of time.
