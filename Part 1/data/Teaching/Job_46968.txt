Description: Assistive Technology can make a big difference to the lives of people with sight loss and with the new Pocklington Assistive Technology (AT) Service we are demonstrating and raising awareness of AT devices and how they can support our service users. We are looking for a coordinator with excellent communication, presentation and organisational skills with an interest in low and high technology to continue to drive this service forward. You must have experience of implementing, coordinating and promoting new services across an organisation. Experience of managing and motivating volunteers is also essential as you will be responsible for recruiting, training and working with our AT Champions Volunteers (some with sight loss) to ensure the AT Sessions are delivered and monitored across Pocklington Centres and events.
