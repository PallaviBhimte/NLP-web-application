The mandatory training you will provide will include: • Common Induction Standards • Manual Handling • Health & Safety • Food Hygiene • Infection Control • First Aid And potentially (given your experience) you could provide more specific training including: • Lone Working • Autism • Mental Health • Deprivation of Liberty • NVQ's in Health and Social Care Applicants from a nonlearning disabilities training background are of course more than welcome to apply, if you have trained staff in other social care backgrounds. You will ideally possess an NVQ Assessors Award, PTTLS, or equivalent qualification. You will be running training course and events, and ensuring that any new legislation is implemented into this training.
