Junior Brokers HAVE to make over ****  **** calls a day to potential investors. You will be making calls from the best qualified lead databases that money can buy. You will have to gain the clients interest and get them to agree to a brochure being sent out to them listing potential investment opportunities. These clients will then be passed over to senior brokers who will then close the deal. Depending on the size of the deal you will get 510% commission.
