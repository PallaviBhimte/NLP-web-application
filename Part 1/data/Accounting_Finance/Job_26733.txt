Title: Senior International Casualty Underwriter
Webindex: 69544185
Company: Oliver James Associates
Description: One of the most recognisable Brands in the London and Global Insurance Markets, this dynamic and growing business has gained their status as a true leader through wise acquisitions and strong organic growth. With a strong focus on effective risk management, and an entrepreneurial underwriting style, they are looking to leverage existing relationships rather than increase Marketshare. An opportunity has arisen within their International Casualty team to assist in the development of their nonUS portfolio. Particular experience of Australian, Latin American and/or Canadian business would be of benefit, as they seek to take advantage of continued opportunities in these territories. The focus will be on industrial corporate risks, and the expectation is that the successful candidate will be autonomous from the outset, hence this is a role for a senior underwriter. You must be able to demonstrate a proven track record of successful underwriting within the International Casualty arena and, given the underwriting style at the Company, the ability to generate new business effectively.
