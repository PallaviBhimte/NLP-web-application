Working alongside an external consultancy and one other DataStage Developer you will be involved with Development, Design and multidimensional modelling of the IBM Data warehouse. The BI team play a vital role ensuring the business is able to make sense of the large volumes of live data coming from the various divisions within the business. This role will see you working closely with the external IBM DataStage team where possible improving your skills and bringing in house the DataStage function. With the flexible resource offered by the external consultancy it is possible for an ETL Developer with exposure to the IBM BI Suite (to include Data Stage) to build on their existing knowledge to take them in to a more Design Architecture role, though it is worth noting a second role for a more senior candidate with Design / Architect knowledge is also being recruited for. Successful candidates will have commercial exposure to Infosphere Data Stage preferably gained in a high traffic environment. Candidates without exposure to version **** will still be considered as training is available and support from the external consultancy. Excellent communication is also a requirement of this role as you will effectively be the bridge between the business and their 3rd party supplier, you will also work closely with internal stakeholders to ensure the Infosphere strategy runs in parallel to corporate goals.
