Title: Deputy Manager  Horse & Groom, Harehatch RG**** ****SB
Webindex: 71956739
Company: Brunning and Price
Description: The Horse and Groom has been serving the needs of locals and passersby alike for some 300 years, and with all that history the building exudes character and atmosphere from every beam and flagstone. Our menu has a spine of freshly prepared, classic British dishes, complemented by more exotic influences from other parts of the world: in other words, modern British cookery. Our passion lies in finding quality ingredients and preparing, cooking and presenting them in a modern but unpretentious way. We are looking for an experienced Deputy Manager with a big front of house character and good knowledge of food, wine and beer to help run the pub alongside the Manager. You will frequently work opposite shifts to the manager, and run the pub in the manager’s absence, so the skill sets needed are broadly the same. You won’t carry the full weight of responsibility for the wellbeing of the business, but you will be the manager’s righthand person, and will be a senior member of the management team, making decisions and directing things on a daily basis. You'll need to understand and love pubs, take real pleasure in making people happy and play a full role in keeping the business profitable, the crew happy and the customers coming back for more. Being a deputy manager is an ideal opportunity to gain knowledge and experience of every aspect of pub life. We see our deputy managers as our managers of the future, and try to promote from within whenever we can. Our rate of growth means that there are exciting opportunities springing up all the time, and you will be able to develop your career at a pace that is appropriate to you.
