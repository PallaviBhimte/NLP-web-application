Description: My client is looking to recruit a number of FLT drivers to join them on a temporary ongoing basis. You would be part of a pool of drivers who would be factored into a weekly rota. You will need to be flexible with your hours and able to work shifts, including nights. The right candidate will be either RTITB or ITTSAR certificated, and be able to operate a **** ton counterbalanced gas powered truck. Ideally your license will state use of LPG and you will have experience using a double handler. We are also interested in hearing from anyone with drivein racking experience. As well as driving the truck your duties will include the use of warehouse management scanning equipment, and some manual duties as well, for example lifting, stacking etc. The interview process will be in two stages: a standard registration interview with a FLT theory test, followed by a practical assessment at the client site.
