Webindex: 71877938
Company: RED SNAPPER RECRUITMENT
Description: Criminal Justice Skills are currently seeking an experienced Programme Tutor to work within the London area on a temporary rolling contract. You will need to have delivered a programme within the last year for your accreditation to still be valid. This client will consider those applicants who are able to work full time, evenings or potentially parttime hours. Ideally you will have delivered, and been trained to deliver 'sex offender' programmes within the London Probation Trust. However, we are still interested to hear from you if you have delivered other 'sex offender' accredited programme training from other probation trusts (i.e TVSOG, NSOG, SOTP). This is a group work delivery role where you are in direct contact with offenders, so you will require a CRB of which Criminal Justice Skills will cover the costs and process for you. You will be required to deliver the whole of the programme and be able to offer post programme support in writing reports. Criminal Justice Skills would like to hear from you if you have the above experiences and are available to work in temporary positions across the UK. If you would like to be considered for this position and have the relevant experience, then please apply to this advertisement by sending us your CV via the application link. Due to the high volume of applications received, if you do not hear from us within **** working days, I am afraid your application has been unsuccessful.

The Red Snapper Group acts as an employment agency (permanent) and as an employment business (temporary)  a free and confidential service to candidates.
