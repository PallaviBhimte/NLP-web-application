Webindex: 71336120
Company: EMBS   People Transfer
Description: This role is a new permanent position to provide the Technical Assurance, Governance and design authority across a wide programme of BAU infrastructure projects at a major global client based in Surrey. Helping to provide the governance and validation for a number of technical designs and solutions you will ensure these BAU projects meet the demands of the business across process control, business impact, key stakeholders and the demands of the internal operations. You will have a broad based technical knowledge and have moved away from the purer technology and design roles to combine senior management including delivery, technical assurance and project management skills. Upcoming projects include the following; Microsoft AD/Exchange deployment, Virtualisation, Networking, VOIP, Security, LAN/WAN and other infrastructure needs. Understanding the impact and requirements you will work to validate designs and collaborate alongside a small operational team of technical business analysts, technical architects, some external vendors and the operations teams. This is a hybrid role and requires individuals who are long since involved in server implementations but those who can understand the wider impact of designs to suit technology needs by stamping their final authority prior to validation for the customer.
