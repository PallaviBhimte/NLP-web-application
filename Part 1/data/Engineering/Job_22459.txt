Title: Architects and Technicians  Kent
Webindex: 72663025
Company: Solution Recruitment
Description: We are currently looking to appoint a number of Technicians and Architects for this leading studio, very near to Sevenoaks. Working on a range of projects including education, commercial and residential schemes, the architects and technicians will work at all stages of design, planning and delivery. The studio has been hugely involved in the recent changes to guidelines on education design, and as such their order book is very healthy for the year. UK experience delivering large scale projects is prerequisite, with ideal candidates having experience in the education sector. The studio uses ArchiCAD but training will be provided where required. ArchiCAD users will be given preference. Because of the location of this role, you will need to have access to a car or motorcycle as the studio does not benefit from easy access to public transport. The location suits those based in West Kent, Surrey or South London. This is a great opportunity to join a leading studio with a busy workload.
