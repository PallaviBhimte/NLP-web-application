Webindex: 69210412
Company: Teaching Support
Description: We are working with a primary school in Rochester who require a teaching assistant to join their team the week before February half term. This is a one to one support role for a pupil in YR with global development delay. Initially you would be required to work two afternoons a week and this would increase on a weekly basis up to full time by Easter. The role would be until July 20****. It is essential that you have experience of working with pupils with SEN and ideally you will have experience of supporting pupils in EYFS or KS1. The pupil has complex needs and has problems with speech and language too. The school is situated just outside Rochester and has a dedicated and long standing senior leadership team. This is a fantastic opportunity for someone looking to gain more experience within SEN as you will receive training throughout the year as well as support from the SENCO and class teacher. For more information please contact us as we would like to interview ASAP.
