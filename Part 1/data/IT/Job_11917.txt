Webindex: 71759835
Company: Infinitium Recruitment
Description: Louis GoffBeardsley here ( uk.linkedin.com/in/ louisbeardsley ). Hope life is treating you well :) Please ignore the following, I have to put it because there's so many generic recruiters out there who get lucky enough to pull a single RubyonRails role at a minor RubyonRails team and post boring rubyonrails adds all day that bury my beautifully crafted, quirky masterpieces :( RUBYONRAILS RUBYONRAILS RUBYONRAILS RUBYONRAILS RUBYONRAILS RUBY RUBY RUBY RAILS RAILS RAILS Now that that's over, I'm recruiting for a RubyonRails team that is ****40 years old Actually that's not true, its the company that is ****0 years old, everyone knows that Rails hasn't been around that long as it was invented in **** by Linus Torvalds. You will be creating RoR Apps which are using ****40 years of content and data (important content from the friggin ****s, not just data sets). This company were early adopters on the London Rails scene though and still are on the forefront of embracing new technology when it comes out. I throw up a bit in my mouth saying that because every recruiter says the company they are recruiting for is 'embracing new technology' but this one actually does and they have these lunch thingys every two weeks where they give presentations to each other purely about new tech they have seen and how they might use it. The teams **** right now and going to be **** There's a lot of diversity expertise in there so even senior dudes will pick some stuff up aswell as get to share knowledge. There's a lot of RubyonRails jobs out there right now (I have access to ALL the best ones, I can show you the entire market without bias). This team is going to appeal those who want to work in a Prestigious British Institution that operates on a global scale that at the same time uses new tech and is at the forefront of commercial RubyonRails usage. Its not another social media platform or ecommerce related either. The company is very very very financially stable and your code will have a direct impact on the universe. Oh, and you get a FREE LUNCH EVERYDAY****  awesome pension package. I'm don't just have the 1 rails job either, i'm working with like 14 friggin companies at the moment. A lot of devs just work with me and fire all of all the other recruiters out there because seriously, any rails team worth its salt is working with me Also I'll help you write your CV and make you look cool before we send you to companies.
