Webindex: 71763802
Company: Pabulum
Description: Based at a school in Waterloo, you’ll be working 8am  2.30pm, Monday to Friday, term time only, and we’d love you to start as soon as possible. With a reputation for excellent service and fabulous food we always put our customers first and as one of our Catering Assistants we expect you to want to do the same. By developing a great working relationship with colleagues, clients and customers alike you will be able to ensure the catering contract you are a part of is always growing in the right direction. There’s a variety of activities for you to get stuck into each day including preparing our delicious food, serving our lovely customers and clearing and cleaning up after service. You’ll need to replenish counters or vending machines where necessary, be confident working on the tills and complete any relevant paperwork. Our people are important to us so there’s plenty of opportunity to learn new skills, feedback your ideas and suggestions and really show us what you can do As this is a school or college, working with children or vulnerable adults, you’ll need to provide us with details of two employment or character references that we can write to and complete an Enhanced CRB Disclosure application form. Please do not contact the school/college direct. All interest in this role is really appreciated but sometimes we're so overwhelmed with responses that we can only contact for interview those applicants whose skills and experience match our requirements for the role. If you have not heard from us within two weeks, unfortunately you have been unsuccessful on this occasion but do keep trying
