Webindex: 68682475
Company: Huntress Group
Description: I am looking for a Lead Ruby on Rails Developer to join a growing startup based in London. They are just about to complete a round of funding and need a Lead Developer who can work on the core product and begin to build a team moving in to next year. The owners of the company have a strong track record in building start up tech companies and have multiple exits to date. We are looking for someone who has a strong understanding of Ruby on Rails and wants to grow into a more senior role. They will consider a senior developer who wants to take a step up in their career and maybe has no opportunity for progression in their current company or a seasoned leader who maybe feels under valued in their current role. This is an exciting time to join the business and could be very rewarding for the right candidate. If you would like to find out more then please send me your CV and I will call you to discuss in much more detail. Huntress does not discriminate on the grounds of age, race, gender, disability, creed or sexual orientation and complies with all relevant UK legislation.
