Description: This impressive global PR consultancy has built its business on developing creative, results orientated campaigns for both marketleading blue chips and fastgrowing startup brands. It is an agency where creativity is fundamental to everything it does. It is now looking to appoint a talented Account Manager or Senior Account Manager to work predominantly on the business side of a huge global technology brand. Rather than being focused on bits and bytes you will drive PR activity in the commercial business space. This will require a strong understanding of areas including the consumerisation of IT and business productivity/solutions. Your primary attribute will be a hunger to drive top quality PR in the business press and beyond, based on your instincts for how organisations can contribute to and shape the business agenda. Your previous roles will have allowed you to work with clients that run multiple programmes targeting business audiences, preferably (although not exclusively) in the technology field, and within an agency environment. You will also have managed and developed junior members of staff both through coaching and mentoring, and more formal career planning. This is a fascinating opportunity to get deeply immersed in the world of business decision makers from startups through small and medium business to large enterprises.
