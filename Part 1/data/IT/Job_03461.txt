Company: Harvey Nash plc
Description: I am currently working with a business which has recently begun a large scale transformation programme leading to the need to recruit a Senior Enterprise Architect/Head of Governance to join the centralised function. To be suitable for this role you must be an experienced enterprise architect with a wealth of experience of implementing architecture governance across a highly complex and 'real time' environment. Enterprise Architecture is still in its infancy within the business and is being implemented following TOGAF principles; as a result qualification within TOGAF would be preferable although experience of working to these principles would be suitable. On top of this, the role is charged with leadership of a small team working across the implementation of architectural governance so experience of team leadership and management will be extremely useful as well as the ability to provide leadership to the wider community and programme team. This role is working as one of the leader of IS strategy across a highly complex and multinational business so a background in a large environment will be crucial as well as the gravitas and background in leading change within this environment. This is a permanent role based in Warwickshire looking to pay to ****/annum  car  benefits. This job was originally posted as www.cwjobs.co.uk/JobSeeking/SeniorEnterpriseArchitect_job****
