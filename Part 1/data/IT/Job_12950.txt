You will work under their Ecommerce Manager and alongside their PPC and SEO experts and take responsibility for the success of their Ecommerce store once visitors arrive on the site.

You will liaise with their merchandising and buying teams and have some influence on pricing and product strategy based on the web analytics data.

To be successful you are likely to have some experience in merchandising but this is secondary to the Ecommerce experience. Finally you will manage both their B2B and B2C websites and have opportunities to take on more responsibility in the future as you look to grow your career.
