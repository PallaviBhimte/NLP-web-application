Move offshore and escape the RDR The Retail Distribution Review (RDR) aims to improve the customer experience of the financial services industry in the UK. In reality what it means to IFAs is that you'll have to sit more exams and your customers will be hit by upfront fees rather than commission being taken out of their returns – a model which is sure to threaten investor numbers and push more advisors away from the industry. RDR comes into effect at the end of 2011. We are offering the opportunity to escape the RDR and work offshore in a less restrictive financial market where the potential to earn, lower taxes, and constant sunshine only add to its appeal. You could join one of our successful teams of Wealth Managers in our international locations utilising our excellent facilities including database systems and business development centres.

(E.g. 30% of upfront fees for 3 years) Pension from Asset Management – Globaleye will take over the management of your clients’ assets and will provide you with a percentage of the trackers, trails, and management fees for the life of the investments.
