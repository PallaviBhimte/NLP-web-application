Description: This large and modern Primary School in Dudley is looking for excellent classroom behaviour managers within a KS**** environment. We have an urgent need for KS1 Teachers to teach all year groups from Reception through to Year **** with Daily Registration with the GTC, Qualified Teacher Status and UK classroom experience within the last 2 years. Pay rates are discussed at interview and depend on your qualifications, experience and flexibility. In return we offer competitive rates of pay, a variety of training opportunities and the help and support of your consultant. At Protocol Education we pride ourselves in providing recruitment with a personal touch to both teachers and schools. This involves being experts in matching our teachers to the right roles and providing feedback and support at every step in your journey with Protocol. Daily supply work is a great way of gaining experience in a variety of different school environments and can often open doors to more long term or permanent opportunities. For those looking for the continuity of working in the same school, we can offer long term supply work on either a part time or full time basis.
