Webindex: 72480372
Company: Triad Resourcing
Description: 2nd line Scheduler/Support Our client is looking for 2nd line Scheduler/Support to join their busy Wintel team. The role will be split into 2 parts: primarily you will be involved in scheduling the change of service within the Wintel team, so that the engineers involved with performing these changes can come in and get the job done quickly with minimal impact to the business. Once this task has been completed, then you will have the opportunity to work with other team members and help with incidents that may occur on the Wintel side of things. This role would suit someone who is a senior Service desk analyst or is currently working as a 2nd Line Wintel Analysts and see themselves working towards 3rd line or a more senior role. This is a long term opportunity, so my client is looking for someone who can work as part of a team, but able to manage their own workload. As the successful candidate you will have proven experience of scheduling incidents and have a technical element on the Wintel and server infrastructure side of things.
