Title: Hyperion Solutions Lead
Webindex: 68495814
Company: SystemsAccountants
Description: My Large London based client has a requirement for a Senior Hyperion Solution specialist to join their existing team to define, manage and lead the delivery of a large number of ongoing projects. The role will focus primarily on their Hyperion systems so the ideal applicant will bring good experience of Essbase, Hyperion Planning and/or HFM from functional and technical perspective. Applicants that have delivered or defined projects before and have assisted in the delivery of process and performance improvement would be particularly suitable. The role will offer exceptional onward promotion opportunities as well as access to a very large system upgrade and enhancement project in the near future. Any broader experience of Oracle applications like OBIEE would also be of benefit given their wider systems environment. Candidates will need to be confident dealing with and managing senior finance stakeholders as well as managing the team beneath them. Experience managing offshore and onshore development teams whilst defining overall EPM/BI and MI strategy would be highly prized. For further information or to apply please contact Piers Reid of SystemsAccountants or email.
