Description: We are currently recruiting for a client of ours who operate within the marketing services industry in Leicestershire. They are looking for a Marketing Analyst to join them on a permanent fulltime basis. Your overall responsibility within this role will be to ensure that clients' databases are clearly and proactively analysed. This will involve managing accounts on a client relationship level as well as hands on analysis. You shall ensure that client projects are completed on time to the agreed quality and timescale, and that other Analysts are providing suitable analysis themselves. Interpretation of data must also be provided and must be accurate, and accounts should be grown alongside account plans which detail how this can be done. Client strategy and advice should be given to ensure that the business is having a positive contribution towards the client. You will manipulate client databases to extract data for analysis, and then carrying out the analysis itself along with report writing and interpretation is also part of the role. The successful candidate will have a minimum of 12 years' experience within a Database/Marketing Analyst position, with extremely well developed Microsoft Access skills. You should be analytical but also be very comfortable in liaising directly with clients.
