Description: A great opportunity to join a rapidly expanding American company at their point of infancy in the UK/European markets my client is a young and exciting provider of customer experience solutions, with an excellent client base in America, and the backing to expand aggressively into the leading European markets. They are starting to make a name for themselves over here, and are keen to bring on a strong, energetic new business salesperson to help drive that growth forward. This is a great opportunity to join a rapidly expanding online company at the ground level and grow as the company does. My client has two elements to their offering; a SaaSbased tool providing brand tracking, audience analysis, social/conversation monitoring and marketing effectiveness measuring, as well as a more complex and very exciting CRMcentric offering. The sales position would see you selling this entire offering to fortune**** companies across the UK market predominantly but also into Europe, into marketing stakeholders. You would be fed some leads, and as the team grows there will be lead generation support in place, but this is a startup environment and as such requires someone who is happy to undertake a full 360 degree sales role from the outset. The ideal candidate will understand that they will need to put the hard hours in to make the most from this role; you will be an online/eCommerce technology enthusiast, with a background of selling SaaS offerings to the value of at least ****k. You will have a track record of reaching and exceeding annual targets of ****k minimum (ideally more), and will show working knowledge of building and maintaining meaningful relationships with senior decision makers. Relevant experience to any of the aforementioned solutions will be beneficial. In short, this is a great opportunity to join a truly exciting company at the start of its growth, and make some excellent money in the process, but to do this requires someone who is happy to put in the graft to get the reward.
