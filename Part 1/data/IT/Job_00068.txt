Description: My client is a wellestablished, provider of specialist cyber security consulting services with a client list consisting of FTSE 100 companies and Government agencies. They are world leaders in many of the technology areas they operate in, producing white papers that are required reading in many boardrooms and IT departments. As part of their continued planned expansion, driven by a massive increase in interest in cyber security, they now wish to hire an additional Senior Security Consultant. Working both on site and at my client's offices, the Senior Consultant will work closely with client's to plan and deliver penetration tests, analyse the results and develop action plans. He or she will take both a strategic view of the customer's business and the longterm threats they face, as well as having the tactical nous to resolve day to day tactical issues. The Senior Consultant will always work for the customer's best interest and will become a trusted partner to their IT team. The successful candidate will have strong background in penetration testing backed probably by at least a degree level standard of education and ideally further qualification. He or she will have excellent knowledge of UNIX, Linux and Windows and a good understanding of application architectures. Knowledge of programming languages such as java, python, shell and C will also be required. Above all we are looking for strong communicators, able to work with both technical and nontechnical staff and articulate complex issues.
