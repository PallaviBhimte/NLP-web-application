Title: Fully Funded PhD Research Studentship
Webindex: 70767942
Company: University of Nottingham
Description: 3 years Faculty of Engineering Applications are invited for a fully funded PhD studentship to join the growing Centre for Structural Engineering and Construction (CSEC) based in the Research Division of Materials, Mechanics and Structures (Faculty of Engineering) at the University of Nottingham, a global top 75 University. The student will work in a dynamic research environment and as part of an interdisciplinary team of researchers and will undertake research related to strengthening and seismic retrofitting of concrete structures with advanced materials. The issue of upgrading concrete structures has been of great importance for over than 30 years or so due to their deterioration. The last may be attributed to ageing, environmental induced degradation, lack of maintenance, need for upgrading so that the existing structures will meet the current design requirements. In addition, seismic retrofit is at least equally important in high seismic risk areas. One of today s stateoftheart techniques is the use of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) materials. Despite the wellestablished advantages of the FRPs as a strengthening material, (high strength to weight ratio, corrosion resistance, ease and speed of application, minimal change of cross section dimensions), the FRP strengthening technique entails a few drawbacks (poor behavior at high temperatures, high costs, inapplicability on wet surfaces or low temperatures), which are mainly attributed to the organic resins used to bind and impregnate the fibers. Recently, with the aim of addressing the above mentioned problems of FRPs, a new structural material was proposed, the socalled TextileReinforced Mortar (TRM). This research will undertake a series of new investigations which are expecting to develop new novel applications of TRM as a strengthening material of concrete. The PhD student will be required to assist in the development and execution of experimental and computational work. Applications are invited from students of high academic merit with a background in structural engineering who have a good experimental experience and who have or expect to graduate with a firstclass degree and a MSc with distinction or equivalents. The student will be required to work within a civil/structural engineering laboratory environment and should have a strong background in structural engineering and constructions materials. Good communication skills will also be required. The PhD student will become part of the Centre for Structural Engineering and Construction (CSEC), which carries out research across the key disciplines of structural engineering. The centre has excellent laboratory facilities. The studentship will cover PhD tuition fees and a tax free stipend for three years (**** for 20****314 academic year) for UK/EU students. An additional **** a year may be awarded for students with a 1 st class degree/ MSc Distinction from a UK Russell Group University or equivalent. Informal enquiries or formal applications with a CV, a brief statement of your research interests, and the names and email addresses of two referees should be addressed to Dr Dionysios Bournas email: dionysios.bournasnottingham.ac.uk via the apply button.
