The Science department will be losing a long standing member of staff in the summer term and so will be making some changes within the science department; including the search for a talented Biology Teacher ready to take on the mantle of second in charge. This is a brilliant faith school that caters for the Orthodox Jewish community in North London; with pupils from more advantaged backgrounds than in most schools, but the proportion with learning difficulties and disabilities is average. Most pupils have white backgrounds although only half are white British. Very few pupils are at the early stages of learning English. Pupils are respectful and hard working, creating different challenges to a typical inner city school. Science is becoming increasingly more popular within the school and especially across GCSE and A level. The school boasts exceptionally high GCSE results (84% A  C including Maths & English) and has won numerous awards over the last couple of years with A level results are improving yet still well above average. The school split between two sites for boys and girls, is well resourced and will be undergoing additional improvements in order to update and develop the separate sites and facilities.
