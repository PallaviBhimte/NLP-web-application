Webindex: 70088265
Company: Nigel Frank International
Description: SharePoint Principal Architect, Central London, ****k, Partner My client is an Enterprise level Microsoft Gold Partner with a wealth of experience in SharePoint working on Tier **** accounts in unison with Microsoft. They have built up an extremely successful SharePoint practice alongside other practises in Microsoft Dynamics CRM, NAV, BI and .NET which does sometimes require integration on a number of projects. My client's requirement for a Principal SharePoint Consultant comes after promotion of their old Principal and their other Architect's not having quite enough experience for a senior role such as this. The role will involve managing SharePoint Architects, Consultants and Developers on multiple SharePoint projects and coordinating project delivery as well as getting hands on with full lifecycle projects where required. Due to the hands on nature of the role you will need to have skills in the full lifecycle from presales, scope, spec, deploy, configure and coding. The role will involve some travel to client sites as is expected in any Architecture/Consultancy role, however, you will not be on the road 100% of the time as you will manage this from the office and from home sometimes. Requirements: • At least 4 years SharePoint experience with proven consultancy skills • Demonstrable full lifecycle SharePoint Architecture skills • Proven knowledge of SharePoint and .NET coding to support hands on requirement when necessary • Excellent communication skills This is a fantastic opportunity to enter into a Senior SharePoint role that will see you have the potential to proceed into potential Practice Lead or Divisional Lead roles at an even more Senior level. On top of this you will have the satisfaction of helping to train/mentor junior consultants proving your extensive experience and knowledge of SharePoint. To discuss this and other exciting Microsoft SharePoint opportunities in more detail please send your CV to n.choudhurynigelfrank.com or call Nobin on **** **** **** in complete confidence ASAP.
