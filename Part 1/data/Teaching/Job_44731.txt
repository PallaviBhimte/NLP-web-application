Company: Kings College
Description: We announce the availability of a 3year Marie Curie Fellowship for Early Stage Researchers in the Theoretical Physics Group in the Mathematics Department of King’s College London, starting in October 2013. The detailed description of the proposed research topics can be found at http://gatis.desy.eu/e****/e****/index_eng.html and http://gatis.desy.eu/e****/e****/index_eng.html These topics include questions in the forefront of theoretical physics relating quantum gravity and string theory to gauge theories. The position is funded within the GATIS network. The scientific goal of the network is to develop and exploit a novel approach to quantum field theory that combines ideas from low dimensional statistical physics and mathematics with more traditional methods of high energy physics. Network participants include leading research centres in Europe such as King’s College London and University of Durham (UK), DESY Hamburg and Humboldt University (Germany), CEA Sacley (France), Nordita (Sweden), Porto University (Portugal). There will be numerous events within the network, including Mathematica Summer Schools in Theoretical Physics, workshops and conferences. The fellows will be taking part in these events. The fellows are also expected to get their PhD degree at the end of the training. Qualified candidates should possess an MSc in theoretical or mathematical physics. In addition, they should be highly motivated to enter a challenging interdisciplinary research environment. Since the position is part of a Marie Curie Initial Training network, strict eligibility rules apply, see GATIS homepage for details at http://gatis.desy.eu/e****/ The candidates should also satisfy the eligibility for the PhD position at King’s College for Theoretical Physics (see www.kcl.ac.uk/prospectus/research/entryrequirements/name/mathematics/alpha/M/header) And posses a language test results (IELTS  **** overall, minimum **** in all skills or TOEFL  **** minimum **** in Reading and Writing and **** in Listening and Speaking). A conditional offer can be made in case the corresponding language test is not available. Fixed term contract for 3 years. Further details and application packs are available on the College’s website at www.kcl.ac.uk/jobs All correspondence should clearly state the job title and reference number RS/CCM/****/****JM .
