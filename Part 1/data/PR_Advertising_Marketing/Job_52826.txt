Webindex: 66701544
Company: AF Selection
Description: Fantastic opportunity to join one of the most prolific PR consultancies in the region at a very exciting time for them as they continue to build on their success, as PR Account Executive. This PR Account Executive role will span both consumer and b2b clients, so it would be great if you do have experience across both sectors, however the client is really interested in personality rather than previous client experience. You will assist across a number of accounts from automotive to retail and professional services, and they are looking for someone who is proactive, positive, with the ability to sell in to the media and who has a good amount of commercial experience with social media. You will run reactive press offices for clients and develop good contacts with the media, as well as writing for releases and features as well as producing comprehensive reports. The client is relatively open in terms of how much experience you might have for this role, but we would expect a minimum of six months from either a placement or internship with an agency up to around two years. This is a very exciting opportunity with a genuine market leader who offers superb training and prospects as well as a number of fantastic benefits. It is essential that you have a full driving license. Our client is looking to interview asap with the possibility of a January 2 nd start (although please still apply if you need to give notice to your current role).
