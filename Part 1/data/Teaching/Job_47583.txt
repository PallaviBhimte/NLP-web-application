Description: So you've got your ****:1 or your 1st, you've travelled for a bit and you've been employed now for some months. How is it? Have you got that is this what I worked hard for feeling? Do you feel that you're only part of a process? Commercial conferences are going on all the time, not just in London but all over the world. They're popular because, whatever industry you're in you need to keep up to date  and there's a social aspect too: people love to network. The roles I deal with concern the preparation of the intellectual content, not the logistics. Our client company is over 20 years old and employs around **** people. It produces conferences in, amongst other sectors, energy, pharma, healthcare, transport and travel, retail and licensing. Its employees work as hard if not harder than anyone else's: the vibe, though, is a little more unbuttoned than in some other places and there's an atmosphere of camaraderie and fun about the place. I look for several attributes: commercial awareness  you should have an interest in business and how it works; sales  you'll need to be persuasive; research  the ability to ferret out information on the phone; communication  you must be able to express yourself clearly and logically; and organisational ability. If you reckon you can tick all these boxes, and you have a good degree, conference production can give you intellectual stimulation, a rewarding package and the opportunity to see a project through from start to finish
