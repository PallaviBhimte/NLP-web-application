Webindex: 65102315
Company: Hays TCE Jobs
Description: An enthusiastic Marine Engineer is required to join a relatively small but growing Engineering consultancy based just outside of Glasgow city centre. This vacancy has come around due to my clientâ€™s increased workload within the Maritime Sector. The successful candidate will have had some previous industry experience within the Marine sector, however, this is not a prerequisite and therefore may come from a Bridges design background. Experience with the design of reinforced concrete and heavy civils design is also desirable. Although this position is predominantly office based, there will be a small element of work involving site inspections of piers and harbours. Additionally, there is opportunity for the candidate to become trained in commercial diving and, where necessary, the successful candidate will have access to the company boats. I look forward to receiving your application.Hays Specialist Recruitment Limited acts as an employment agency for permanent recruitment and employment business for the supply of temporary workers.
