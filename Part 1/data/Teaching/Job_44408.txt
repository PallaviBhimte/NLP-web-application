Description: teacheract is recruiting supply teachers from ALL subject areas but we are ESPECIALLY interested in those teachers with a Primary DRAMA specialism. teacheract provides Primary Schools in London with carefully selected supply teachers to deliver Drama workshops to enhance and maximise the curriculum. Communication, confidence and creativity are the three pillars of our teaching philosophy. We build these skills through Drama. We often pair the Drama with curriculum subjects such as RE and Drama, Art and Drama or French and Drama. ?Our Drama workshops give children the opportunity to be creative, to collaborate and to communicate their own ideas  to become independent and resilient thinkers and to believe in themselves In addition to our Drama specialists we also provide teachers that specialise in a range of other subjects. Our core values remain the same for these teachers too  that they enhance and add value and they collaborate with schools with the aim of delivering outstanding lessons. If you believe that you could teach with our core values in mind and could strive to deliver outstanding lessons, then get in touch and we'll interview you. We'll also offer you very competitive rates of pay should you join our team. We look forward to hearing from you The teacheract team.
