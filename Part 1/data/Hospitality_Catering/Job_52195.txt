Company: sketch
Description: EAT MUSIC DRINK ART sketch is so much more than the sum of **** restaurants, **** bars and a Parlour, it is a venue where food, art and music come together to create a unique experience right at the heart of Mayfair. With Mourad Mazouz, French Master Chef Pierre Gagnaire has developed imaginative, bold and delicious food, from the ground breaking 1 Michelin Lecture Room to the Parlour s scrumptious cakes. Our staff shines when it comes to providing the sketch experience to customers. They won t hesitate to take the centre stage if it means creating that â€˜je ne sais quoi which sketch is famous for. With that in mind, sketch is now recruiting for a variety of front stage roles; from Commis Waiters to Senior Head Waiters, we are looking for unique and bubbly characters, true entertainers with a passion to perform.
