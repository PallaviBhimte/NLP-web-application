Description: An interesting and challenging position has become available for 2 Medical Helpdesk Advisor's in Northamptonshire. With a nursing qualification or a specialist in the field of degenerative disease you will be responsible for handling calls from customers/patients with vast and varied enquiries. It will be your responsibility to personally talk to the client or family of a sufferer. Therefore we seek a caring individual with an empathetic ear. Due to the nature of this position, applicants are required to specifically have knowledge of medical terminology and be able to translate into laymanâ€™s terms. Applicants should respect the privacy and sensitivity of every patient in every instance and will possess excellent communication skills. This would suit someone who was looking to come out of nursing but still looking to use their skills and make a difference, alternatively it would be good for a graduate who has potentially decided not to directly pursue a nursing career. Either way we look forward to hearing from you
