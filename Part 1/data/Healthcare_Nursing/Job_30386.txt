Webindex: 46633523
Description: My client operates a number of quality driven nursing and residential care homes throughout the UK, and holds the interests of their service users at the heart of everything that they do. They now have a requirement for a home manager for their 80 bedded nursing and residential home in the West Midlands. This post will present a challenge for its new manager, as (due to ill health)it has been without a good leader for several months, and now needs a strong and well experienced manager to lead the home forward. The home has a seperate EMI residential unit and has a diverse ethnic population, who's needs and wishes are a priority within the home, along with a staff group who have been long standing and who believe that they know what is best for their residents Our client is looking for candidates who are nurse qualified, preferably with a recognised managerial award, and who have strong leadership skills.
