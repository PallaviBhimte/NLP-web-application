Description: A well established IT Recruitment Agency working on behalf of a prestigious client are looking to hire a proficient Oracle Production DBA with good knowledge of Linux (not in a Sys Admin capacity but more slanted towards the ability to check correct packages, perimeters, libraries etc). Candidates are invited to apply with at least three years production experience within an Oracle DBA capacity (****gR**** and ****gR****). Candidates should also have good knowledge of RAC and experience of Data Guard and ASM. Unix Scripting knowledge is required, ideally Bash. The department (currently consisting of the Oracle DBA Manager and four DBA's) are looking to move into Dev Ops with more of a cutting edge prospective so will be introducing Puppet and Ruby. If the successful applicant does not currently have these skills, inhouse training will be given when these technologies are introduced into the department in the foreseeable future. Applicants should be selfmotivated with attention to detail and once settled, should be confident to work on their own projects as well as daytoday ops. Although not immediately, there possibly could, at some point in the future, be the potential to be placed on the On Call Shift Rota with additional remuneration available for this.
