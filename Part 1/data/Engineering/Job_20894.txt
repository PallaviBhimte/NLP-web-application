Webindex: 71631709
Company: Calibre Search Ltd
Description: This is an interesting position for someone with an all round interest in energy and sustainability spanning IES modelling and the provision of sustainability advice. In this position you will be using your knowledge of building services and engineering to model existing designs from external consultants to demonstrate how they will work when constructed. A key element of this role is the provision of advice to those consultants and your ability to produce reports detailing your findings and recommendations and findings. Ideally when applying for this position you will already have experience of using IES to produce models for buildings or a similar package and it is essential that you can demonstrate a knowledge of building services and how they integrate with the fabric of a building. Training is available to build upon your basic knowledge, but it is crucial that you can demonstrate core knowledge of building modelling/building physics, initially in your CV. This is an ideal opportunity for a graduate engineer looking for that crucial first opportunity within industry, or for someone who is looking for the chance to move in to modelling as a full time role and seeking some of the best experience that the industry has to offer.
