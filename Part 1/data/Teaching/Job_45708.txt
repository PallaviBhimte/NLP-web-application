Description: Secondary Teachers seeking supply teaching in Bath, get in touch Regular requests from Secondary schools for supply, longterm contracts and permanent cover means that we're constantly recruiting and have a high demand right now. If you're a newly qualified or experienced teacher we can tailor the type of work we offer to fit with your experience and what types of schools you want to work in. Working through an agency has become a respected way of gaining valuable experience, often leading onto longterm cover roles and helping to secure a permanent position after 'supplying' regularly. As an NQT, certain longterm cover roles can count towards your induction. Many teachers that are fully qualified choose supply too as supply teaching can offer a flexible working pattern so, for many teachers supply can work well for them and allow them to pursue other interests without the commitment of contracted employment. What we look for:  QTS (qualified teacher status) in the UK  Formal teaching qualification  Positive we can help.
