Description: THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER FACULTY OF ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES SCHOOL OF MECHANICAL , AEROSPACE AND CIVIL ENGINEERING Lecture in Thermal Hydraulics The School of wishes to appoint a lecturer in thermal hydraulics. Research may be in computational modelling or experimental, preferably both. There are four research rigs in the School making a unique facility supported by an experimental officer. Computational modelling is particularly strong in thermofluids and the new lecturer will join a strong team in thermal and nuclear power science and technology. This activity is an important part of the Dalton Nuclear Institute. The School has **** academic staff delivering main stream education to undergraduate and postgraduate students in Aerospace, Mechanical and Civil Engineering. Its research is centred around five main research groups comprising Aerospace; Energy, Environment and Climate Change; Structures, Dynamics and Extreme Loading; Manufacturing and Management; and Nuclear. Required are international level or worldleading research expertise in thermal hydraulics; a willingness and ability to deliver lectures to large classes, supervise group and individual projects, and personal student supervision; education to PhD level with a background in mechanical engineering or related discipline, or equivalent experience; a demonstrated capability of publishing in highquality peer reviewed journals and international conferences, and competency in research project supervision and pursuing links with industry and other academic researchers (nationally and internationally).
