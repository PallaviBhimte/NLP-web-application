Company: Potential Recruitment
Description: Our client operates both nationally and internationally and has modern state of the art offices in the centre of Crewe. Business continues to thrive and they are looking for one or two additional members for the engine driver teams of their business. Quite simply without these people doing these vital roles the business would not function. There are two teams to choose **** The Analyst Team Here you will complete credit checks prior to the company accepting new customers so it is vital that these are thorough and accurate but speed is essential too. Ideally you will have done some credit checking in a previous role. You will use Equifax and Dun and Bradstreet. You will work closely with the Underwriting and Sales teams to set credit limits and make sure new accounts are ready to go. **** The Monitoring Team Here you will monitor client accounts to make sure they are working within agreed credit limits. Any direct debts that get returned have to be checked and if required accounts are then put on hold. Some credit checking or some limited credit control experience works well on this section. Overall the company offers a structured career path and will fund relevant professional qualifications if you want to progress
