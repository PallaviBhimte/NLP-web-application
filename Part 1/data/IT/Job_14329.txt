Description: ADAMS ENGINEER Based: Warwickshire Rate: ****p/h Job Purpose: The modelling of new Chassis concepts. Key Responsibilities and Tasks: Support the establishment of kinematic and compliance targets for all Aston Martin suspension systems. Develop hard points for suspension systems and steering systems. Develop bush rates to enable vehicle to meet compliance targets. Develop full vehicle model with representative component masses and inertia's. Determine ARB/spring stiffness to achieve handling balance and ride frequencies. Complete ride, handling, steering, and braking tests on ADAMS and study the effects of kinematics and compliance under various load conditions. Update model with component stiffness figures as they become available. Assess effects and suggest any changes required to maintain targets. Plot results on a standard format for consistency to support progress evaluations. Power Train mounting system characteristics to be incorporated into vehicle modelling. Investigate vehicle dynamics issues arising during development using simulation models. Suggest improvements and use measured vehicle data to update models Qualifications and Experience: Engineering Degree in appropriate discipline essential. Completion of ADAMS training course essential. Extensive background as a simulation engineer within an automotive or automotive components supplier group. Good working knowledge of all relevant ADAMS simulation tools including ADAMS CAR. Capable of studying K&C data, correlating it with models, comparing results, and take actions to makes sure differences are fully understood and accounted for.
