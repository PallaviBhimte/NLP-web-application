Company: Media Contacts
Description: This is an opportunity for a talented, professional PR and marketing Senior Account Executive or Account Manager to help grow a fantastic business. 2013 is going to be a big year for my client, a legal PR agency and marketing practice with a broad range of clients from startups to big names in the legal sector. This is a genuinely rare opportunity. The role will involve, amongst other duties, writing press releases, blog copy, running the social media strategy and updating the website for the agency, media relations and research. You may be a Senior Account Executive, ready for a promotion, or already an Account Manager looking to specialise and help create a business. Either way, an interest in the legal sector is essential, but experience of it is not, as long as you can demonstrate the ability to turn complex, technical language into comprehensible, captivating copy. Basic knowledge of some or all of Google, Google analytics, adwords, webinars and HTML would be ideal. Certainly a passion for social media and it`s place in PR and marketing is essential. Some event management experience would also be beneficial. This boutique agency is run by wellrespected experts in the field of law. They are friendly and approachable and pride themselves on looking after their staff, in particular by ensuring team members have a healthy worklife balance. As such, they will consider the possibility of flexible working/working from home, once probation has been passed. The agency is light on its feet so decisions can be made quickly and the successful candidate will be reporting into the directors.
