Title: Lead Wireless Algorithm Designer
Webindex: 69265141
Company: Redline Group
Description: The successful Lead Wireless Algorithm Designer will have endtoend design responsibility for taking current and next generation wireless communication systems from concept to reality. A thorough appreciation of relevant standards will be exploited in identifying key market opportunities; this toplevel goal will then be taken through algorithm development, plus floating and fixedpoint system simulations analyses. The design would then be taken to FPGA implementation by the individual or the broader team. The resulting solutions are key to my clients continuing success with their customers, and are provided to illustrate tool flow and device features as well as giving a starting point for design and accelerated timetomarket. The wide spectrum of responsibilities would include significant innovation, both in algorithm design and implementation. This is reflected in both patent submissions and publications. The successful Lead Wireless Algorithm Designer would also have a broader responsibility to the company, in terms of driving forwards future projects as well as product requirements for devices, tools and IP. The successful Lead Wireless Algorithm Design Engineer will require the following skills: •Wireless Communications systems from a physical layer perspective and link level aspects eg modulation, equalisation, beamforming and digital RF card •Algorithm development and verification tools for DSP applications (eg Matlab) •Forward error correction techniques •DSP algorithm design through to implementation in ASIC or FPGA Candidates with Remote Radio Head (RRH) design experience would be desirable but this is by no means essential. As well as the above skills and experience the successful Lead Wireless Algorithm Designer will need to have a PhD or a BSc/ MSc(1st or ****) in Electrical/Control Engineering with equivalent experience. If you believe you have the required experience, are prepared to work in Buckinghamshire and would be interested in an exciting opportunity to progress your career and really be involved in the design of next generation technology, please send an up to date CV to JBeanRedlinegroup.Com or call Jabe Bean on [blocked] quoting reference number JAB  ****/****
