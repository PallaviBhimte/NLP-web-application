Description: Market Research Interviewer â€“ Immediate opportunities available A fantastic opportunity has arisen to work immediately, and increase your earning potential on a part time basis. Experience is not essential as full training will be provided. The position is based from home and requires a full Drivers Licence, your own vehicle and access to a fixed home telephone line or Broadband and the ability to build rapport with people. My client is looking for Market Research Surveyors throughout High Wycombe and surrounding areas to carry out market research surveys in peoples' homes. This is NOT a sales role, however no prior appointments have been made so this is essentially a cold calling position. You will be asking people to participate in interviews, with questions from third parties including major blue chip companies, political and social groups. You will have to commit to working at least three days a week, one of which must be during the weekend. A working day will be for six hours; Monday to Friday  2pm to 8pm and Saturday/Sunday  10am to 4pm. However, there may be requirements to work up to six days a week which will boost your earning potential. You will be targeted to complete ****/**** surveys per day and for the first month to help support you our client will offer you a basic rate plus expenses. Once you have completed your first month and are achieving ****/**** completed surveys you will then move on to a Pay per Survey rate which increases your earning potential, expenses are also covered. This is a permanent position with a leading UK Market Research company with fantastic opportunity to progress into more senior positions or develop into specialised interviewing groups. This is a great chance for those who require a flexible approach towards their working days. For more information please contact Aisha on **** **** **** or email your CV and contact details to:
