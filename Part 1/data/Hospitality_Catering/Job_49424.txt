Description: DEPUTY MANAGERS We are currently recruiting for Deputy Manager positions for a number of our key clients across the UK, many of whom have registered their vacancies with us and us alone, choosing Cherryred as the consultancy of choice. Are you a Deputy Manager who wants to develop your career with a well known and expanding group? Are you a Deputy Manager who would you prefer to work for an independent business with an excellent local reputation, but wants to raise their profile? Are you a Deputy Manager who just wants to work for a company who will dedicate their time to training and developing your career? Are you an experienced Deputy Manager who is just ready for a change? If you answered yes to any of these questions, we would love to hear from you. Please apply now, and one of our consultants will call you shortly to confidentially discuss your career goals.
