Description: Cerebellar contributions to cognitive functions in Man Supervisor: Dr. Martyn Bracewell Closing Date: March 4th ****01**** Applications are invited for a threeyear PhD studentship in the School of Psychology, Bangor University. This studentship is fully funded by the School of Psychology. It will be under the supervision of Dr. Martyn Bracewell, Senior Lecturer and Consultant Neurologist. The studentship is available from October 1st ****013 (or as soon as possible thereafter). The studentship includes payment of UK / EU level tuition fees, a maintenance allowance of approximately **** and an annual research allowance of **** Project description: In my lab, we use a number of techniques to study human brain function. These include:  Behavioural studies in healthy volunteers and neurological patients from my own and my colleagues clinical practices.  fMRI and in vivo fibre tract tracing (DTI) of neural connections.  noninvasive brain stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is largely used to quantitate cortical excitability and to induce temporary lesions .  We have recently introduced a relatively novel technique of noninvasive brain stimulation: transcranial current stimulation (tCS). It is used to modulate ongoing brain activity. Unlike TMS, it can be used to potentiate as well as worsen function. By using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), we can modulate endogenous brain rhythms.  EEG recordings  When appropriate, we use combinations of the above techniques. The area of particular interest for this PhD is the cerebellum. It has traditionally been viewed as a neural structure dedicated to motor control and motor learning. Evidence from a number of techniques, including patient studies, functional imaging and brain stimulation, suggests that it also contributes to cognitive and emotional regulation. However, the nature of the cerebellum s contribution to these nonmotor functions remains uncertain. In particular, 1) How the cerebellum influences, and is influenced by, cortical activity during nonmotor tasks is unclear. 2) The functional anatomy of cerebellar nonmotor functions is only partially understood. Preliminary work from my lab, using disruptive theta burst TMS, suggests that, in spatial working memory (WM), there may be functional specialisation, with more medial cerebellar structures involved in encoding, and more lateral left structures in the storage, of items in WM. We plan to explore these finding further; for example: 1) Using DTI to visualise cerebellar connections to the prefrontal and parietal cortices (which have been implicated in encoding and storage respectively). 2) Correlating individuals performance on WM tasks with strength of these connections. 3) Modulation of performance with noninvasive stimulation of cortical and cerebellar sites. 4) Studying patients with focal cerebellar lesions. Another area of interest is the role of the cerebellum in language. One possible project would include studying participants with dyslexia, who, in addition to having specific language difficulties, may have cerebellar motor deficits. The precise topics for investigation will be determined according to the student's particular interests, but she or he would be expected to gain experience of a number of experimental approaches. We are looking for a highly motivated and enthusiastic applicant with a strong interest in neuroscience. Prior research experience with one or more of the techniques used in the lab would be an advantage, but is not essential. Programming skills, including the programming of experiments, would be a strong advantage. The successful applicant is expected to be able to work independently, but also as a member of a larger research team. International students are welcome to apply; however our studentships only cover fees at the UK/EU level. Shortlisted candidates will be interviewed. Informal enquiries about the project should be directed to Dr. Martyn Bracewell ( m.bracewellbangor.ac.uk ), and enquiries about the application process to Shanti Shanker ( s.shankerbangor.ac.uk ) How to Apply Applications for this studentship will be considered until 4th March 2013 .
