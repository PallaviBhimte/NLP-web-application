Description: I am looking for an experienced engineer to repair and refurbish forklifts for a client near Tamworth. Ideally you should have experience of working on forklift trucks, but we would like to speak to people who are experienced vehicle mechanics or plant fitters. The right person should be hungry for work and be willing to work extended hours and Saturdays. In return you will be provided a good salary in line with your experience. A full driving license is essential as occasional outside work may be required for which a vehicle will be provided.
