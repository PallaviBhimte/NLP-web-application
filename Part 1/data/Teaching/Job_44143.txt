Description: RE Teacher (Religious Education Teacher): A fantastic high achieving school located in the heart of central London is looking to appoint an RE teacher (Religious Education Teacher) from as soon as possible on a full time, temporary to permanent basis. The school performs well in terms of academic achievement (over 90% AC grades at GCSE last year) and pupil behaviour at the school tends to be excellent.

The successful RE teacher will be expected to teach RE at KS**** to GCSE standard. An ALevel Religious Education timetable may be available to a suitably qualified and experienced RE teacher but teaching to ALevel standard is not a requirement for applying to this role. The school is happy to accept applications from newly qualified RE Teachers as well as from RE teachers with more experience. Overseas trained RE teachers are also welcome to apply. All RE /Religious Education teacher applicants should have Qualified Teachers Status or the NARIC recognised equivalent. To express an interest in this opportunity and for more information, please forward an updated CV to Gavin as soon as possible.
