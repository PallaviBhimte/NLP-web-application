Company: Randstad Education
Description: Our client, a College in WestonSuperMare require an A Level Chemistry teacher to start immediately until the end of the academic year. The teaching load is for two AS level groups and two A**** level groups. The College use the AQA specification and students ideally need to get on and do their ISAs (internally assessed practical tests) asap. We are also keen for someone to teach a three hour session to access to HE students (ie adult learners at level 3) on a Monday afternoon. Please apply immediately if this sounds like the role for you. All posts are subject to a detailed reference and enhanced CRB disclosure check
