Webindex: 66906393
Description: My client is a young buck in the financial services world and as a result of some shrewdly calculated risks and clever planning, they are expanding into a field where others have stuck to tradition and been left behind. Spread over several sites across the UK, my client is looking to enhance the Peterborough operations as this is a key site for many of the middle office functions of the business and in this instance, the mortgage collections team. We are looking for a team leader with experience of retail banking or ideally mortgage collections to lead a small team as well as creating the policies, strategies and processes for the department to ensure that risk and losses are minimised. You will also be responsible for the day to day management of your team and their performance as well as interacting with multiple stakeholders across the business, engaging with them to support the continued growth of the business. Interviews will be held in the next 2 weeks so don't delay in contacting us with an outline of your experience.
