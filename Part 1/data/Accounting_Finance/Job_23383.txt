Description: We are working on behalf of our blue chip client in Birmingham to appoint a dynamic and highly credible Group Project Controller. Due to the rising demands on the Group Financial Controller of the business you will cover a raft of Head Office activities around financial and management reporting, group cashflow, group performance review and statutory compliance. You will face off daily to the most senior finance and nonfinance staff within this organisation. As such the experience and challenge you will receive in this role will be second to none. You will be an ACA qualified accountant (or equiv) and of graduate calibre  this is unfortunately not negotiable. We are looking for a high potential individual and to extent, your career path to date is not of huge relevance. That said if you are working in industry, you will probably be working at Group level in a complex, multinational blue chip business already. We would also encourage Managers, Senior Managers or Directors currently in a Big 4 audit firm to apply. Our client is a listed business in Birmingham that is a global market leader in their field. Due to a significant upturn in recent performance, the Group Financial Controller of this business is looking to recruit an individual that will have the potential to be their successor.Only applicants with a suitable amount of UK based experience and who have a legal right to work within the UK will be considered.
