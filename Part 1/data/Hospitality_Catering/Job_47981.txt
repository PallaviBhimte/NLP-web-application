Company: Clear Selection
Description: Are you fun loving, bubbly and love meeting new people? I have a fantastic opportunity for a real hospitality lover to progress their career as a trainee assistant manager. Working in a great gastro pub near Oxford, this position requires someone with ambition, charisma and a personality that can make patrons feel glad they visited. Ideally you would have at least a years experience in an assistant managerial or supervisory role within a hospitality establishment similar, but essentially it is your personality an ambition that will determine your success  not your experience. As my client believes, you can teach someone to run a pub, but you can't change how they are. This is 100% true, and the chance for a trainee assistant manager to work with an employer like this is quite the opportunity. With a great starting salary of **** and committed training to ensure you learn all the necessary skills to run a successful and very busy gastro pub, this position will not be available for long. If you have the right attitude, some experience and a passion for hospitality that provides you with drive in the workplace, whether it's mixing drinks or organising events then send your CV and call **** **** **** Salary **** Ref ****CW Consultant Chris Wilson  Teamed up with Tara within our successful Recruitment Division.  / **** **** We are honest, fast paced and truly passionate about Recruitment.
