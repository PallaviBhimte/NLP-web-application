Description: Maths tutors required to work with learners at home or in small groups to improve understanding and help towards exam preparation. Learners are aged between **** and **** and tutors must have knowledge of the National Curriculum at all Key Stages. We have a particular need for teachers of Primary school age, for GCSE and for A Level Maths. Tutors must have at least degree level qualification or appropriate teaching experience, and a clear Enhanced CRB police check. Also essential is the ability to relate to children, to inspire and encourage learning and develop a positive experience for the learner. Patience and flexibility are also essential to the post. Hours are agreed between the tutor and family and the role is often long term once a working relationship is established. This is a very rewarding post which will appeal to those with a passion for Maths.
