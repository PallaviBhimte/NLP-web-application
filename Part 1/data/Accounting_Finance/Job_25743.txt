Description: A growing accountancy practice in the Tayside area has opportunity for an ambitious Tax Supervisor to join their existing team of tax professionals. Enjoying a prolonged and sustained period of growth, the firm has a diverse portfolio of clients who benefit from the range of services offered and the personal business relationships. The successful candidate will enjoy the support from senior members of staff, whilst having the autonomy to develop their own client portfolio and have a directly client facing role. You will provide advisory and planning work, using your technical skills to produce high quality results for your clients which are largely owner managed businesses. Reviewing the work of more junior staff will be part of your role, as will encouraging their development and progression. You will be a qualified tax professional (CTA or ATT) and have experience of a practice environment. The successful candidate is likely to have a mixed tax background, although a bias towards personal tax rather than corporate would be best suited to this opportunity. You will be ambitious to progress and be enthusiastic to be part of a team which prides itself on exceeding client expectation. In return, you can expect competitive renumeration, the opportunity to progress quickly in your career and a fantastic benefits package.
