Description: At RBS, the vision of UK Retail (including the RBS and NatWest branch networks) is to become Britain's most helpful and sustainable bank. Our people are key in helping us achieve this, which is why we place a high priority on recruiting the very best people with the right skills, experience and behaviours. With the customer at the heart of everything we do, our Customer Advisers lead the way in providing a level of service we can be proud of. Working with our RBS or NatWest branch teams, you'll build and maintain essential customer relationships; whether as the welcoming face of RBS or conducting a personal onetoone review of their finances and requirements. With a previous background in a sales or target driven environment, you'll keep a full diary of appointments with customers, identifying and fulfilling their needs or referring them to specialists throughout RBS. And thanks to a thorough knowledge of the bank's products and services, you'll use your customer service experience and relationship building skills to help some of our 13 million customers make the right decisions with their money.
