Company: Gregory James
Description: Network Consultant (contract)  London: The UK`s leading Problem Diagnosis specialists are currently seeking an experienced Network Consultant to join their problem diagnosis and troubleshooting team on a rolling contract basis. You will be tasked with the delivery of firstclass troubleshooting and performance analysis services, solving endtoend problems for a large bluechip client base with complex multitiered systems. The company will help you deliver their services by providing advanced training with excellent support and mentoring, and ask in return that applicants are able to demonstrate the ability and acumen to deliver their troubleshooting services on a consultancy basis. The successful Network Consultant is probably seen as a `GoTo` person by their peers, possessing a proven grasp of the fundamentals of IT, and will be someone who is not afraid to step outside of their comfort zone. This role requires a real desire to learn about the internal workings of systems and the use of diagnostic tools, as well as a strong consultative approach to problemsolving. From a technical perspective, the right Network Consultant will have extensive knowledge of J****EE/Java as well as a good understanding of network fundamentals. Experience of working with both Microsoft and UNIX/LINUX environments would be ideal and any experience of using databases would be looked upon favourably. An understanding of, and previous exposure to, diagnostic tools and problem solving techniques would be advantageous, too. This role requires a person who not only has the technical skills and experience, but who also takes a commanding (handson) consultative approach to tasks. This is a great opportunity to join a marketleading company, working on prestigious client sites, where your willingness to step outside your specialist disciplines, and abilities, will be constantly tested. If you`re a Network Consultant, interested, and would like to apply please send me your CV asap.
