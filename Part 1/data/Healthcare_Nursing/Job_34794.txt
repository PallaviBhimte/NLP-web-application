Webindex: 69614016
Description: Police Custody Nurse Cheshire **** per annum Have you ever thought about working outside the NHS? Forensic nurses work in the field of clinical forensic medicine. They are contracted by their local police force and in a lot of cases by medical companies that hold a contract with a force. Recruit****health are working with one of the UK’s leading providers of medical services to police forces in the UK. They are seeking RGN’s to move into this interesting field of nursing. You are not required to have worked as a custody nurse, although this will be an advantage, however you will need UK experience and full right to work in the UK. Most of the work takes place within the police custody suites but some cases will be managed at addresses specified by the police in a particular case. As a Custody Nurse you will be supported by an experienced team of doctors and nurses, and work as part of a multidisciplinary team. The main custody suites are located in Runcorn, Blacon and Middlewich. To be eligible for these roles you must have a full UK driving licence, be a registered RGN, full membership of the NMC, eligibility to work in the UK, and you must have been resident in the UK for at least the last 3 years. Previous nursing experience obtained within a custody or AE environment would be desirable. These roles suit experienced nurses who are comfortable working unsupervised in unusual environments where their experience and expertise is highly valued.
