Webindex: 68690199
Company: Ashdown Appointments Ltd
Description: I am searching for a Deputy Manager for a traditional pub/restaurant set in the beautiful Hampshire countryside. This is a key role within the management team and calls for someone with extensive experience of quality pub dining. This is a great opportunity to help drive the business forward. To make a success of this position you will need to have plenty of confidence and energy but above all you will need a natural warmth and charismatic style that sets you apart from the crowd. The company is enjoying tremendous success and although now a growing group, each property is totally different. Their General Managers are given a great deal of autonomy and it is true to say that this company genuinely celebrates individuals. They prefer down to earth personalities who are able to think on their feet rather than corporate management operators. If you are thinking about making a move and would like me to contact you regarding this particuarly vacancy  please forward a copy of your CV and contact details.
