Webindex: 71675038
Company: Michael Page Finance
Description: This role represents an excellent opportunity for an established Financial Controller looking for their first FD role, or an existing Finance Director looking to move laterally into a very ambitious business. Working closely with the Board and with a plan ultimately to succeed the incumbent, the initial remit will be to modernise controls, systems and processes  bring the infrastructure and the culture of the finance team from that of a small, entrepreneurial business to a true SME. There will also be plenty of opportunities to get involved with commercial and strategic projects for the CEO and FD. The succession to FD will be dependent on the timing of a transaction  upon which it is likely the position would include an equity stake. The successful candidate will be a strong accountant with the balance of strength as a Controller and appetite and ability to be the Director. Previous experience in a fastmoving sector such as retail or FMCG is highly desirable; experience of working for a PE or VCbacked business would be helpful, although not essential. Our client is a growing VCbacked FMCG business with ambitious plans for further growth. Basic salary in the **** to **** range, plus benefits. Your application will be reviewed by Michael Page. Please be aware we receive a high volume of applications for every role advertised regularly receive applications from candidates who exceed the job credentials. We will only contact you within the next 14 days if you are selected for interview. Where specific UK qualifications are required we will take into account overseas equivalents.
