Company: Altmore IT Recruitment
Description: Gateway to Automated Testing  C .NET stack Salary Excellent  Package I am leading an urgent search for software testers with robust familiarity with testing principles and some development experience to join a new team based in Belfast working on components of a highavailability, scalable, distributed trading application. This role is a great chance to get exposure to automated testing if your career has only comprised manual testing thus far. In this role you will learn how to create testing solutions and test frameworks, working closely with more senior testers in an environment where high volumes of data pass through this application every second. Some sort of OO development / engineering experience will be needed though, as developing these test harnesses and tools adopt similar principles. To succeed in this role, you'll have a desire to get into automation, a strong track record of manual testing thus far in your career, ideally in the C .NET world (but we will consider Java), some previous software development exposure, and a selfmotivating character.
