Description: My client is looking for a Dynamic Nursing home manager. This Young Small group has high and realistic aspirations for its growth and are offering a super opportunity to the right manager to take over a home already established as a 22 bedded nursing home. This home in due course will be extended and refurbished to bring it up to luxurious standards.

My client is looking for a manager who has high standards of care and whose attitude is that if the home delivers excellent client care then the rest of the home will be excellent too. They are looking to recruit someone who has the potential to step up when the home is extended to 40 beds. I deal opportunity for someone who has been acting manager and wants to take the reigns and run their own home. If this sounds like you then please apply to Louise Henwood
