Description: Bluebird Care (Sevenoaks) needs Home Care workers …for the following shifts: ****) early to midmorning; ****) evenings; ****) overnight; ****) weekend all hours. We visit the homes of elderly, disabled and other vulnerable adults to provide a range of care services which enable them to remain living independently at home and away from residential care for as long as possible. We are a “high end” agency, aiming to pay great rates for great carers: ****  **** per hour, plus ****p per mile, plus holiday pay. Experience is not essential as we provide a comprehensive induction and training program, as well as regular and ongoing supervision both in the office and out in the field. What is essential is the right attitude – you need to be hardworking and dedicated to the job, with a calm and patient demeanour and an ability to remain professional and perform under occasionally stressful circumstances, but above all, you need to be ****00% committed to helping improve the quality of life of vulnerable adults. You also need: 1) a valid driving license, and taxed and MOT’d car which you could use for work; ****) to be able to come cleanly through an enhanced CRD background check; ****) to be resident within Sevenoaks District, i.e. pay your council tax to Sevenoaks District Council; ****) to be able to communicate clearly in English with someone who may be confused or hard of hearing.
