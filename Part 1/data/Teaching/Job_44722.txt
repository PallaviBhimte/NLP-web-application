Description: Project: Modular Invariant Rings of Finite Groups Supervisor: Peter Fleischmann The theory of groups and their invariants is the mathematical language for analyzing symmetries. The project investigates open questions about the structure of modular rings of invariants of finite groups. This is a particularly active field of current research, where one uses methods from algebra, arithmetic and representation theory. Keywords include:  Polynomial property and depth of invariant rings;  localisations and their properties (Galois property, regularity);  local cohomology of modular invariant rings and their modules. The School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science The School offers a lively research culture with a thriving group of around **** taught postgraduates students and almost **** postgraduate students, postdoctoral researchers and academic staff. Kent is among the best researchintensive universities in the UK. In the **** Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), the university was ranked 24th out of 159 institutions for its worldleading research, with six of our subject areas (including statistics) in the top ten nationwide. Details of the research undertaken by the School can be found at: http://www.kent.ac.uk/smsas/postgraduate/phdapplications.html The funding This project is one several projects offered by the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science. The projects compete for scholarship funding with the scholarships awarded to the best applicants meeting the advertised criteria. The scholarships are offered at the standard UK Research Councils' rate (currently ****) and will cover the tuition fees at the Home/EU rate for a period of 3.5 years. Some scholarships may be offered as Graduate Teaching Assistantships. Entry Requirements All candidates must have an excellent academic track record in Mathematics and hold a good Honours degree in a relevant subject or equivalent. A Masters qualification such as an MSc or MMath or research experience would be advantageous.
