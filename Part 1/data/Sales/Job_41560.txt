Aaron Wallis is a dynamic sales recruitment business that has steadily grown and increased market share over the last 3 years.

For full information including thorough job specification, skills and competencies required and 'how to apply' view: http://www.aaronwallis.co.uk/work_for_us.aspx Please read the whole of this advert before applying. We regret that we cannot consider candidates that do not meet the following criteria or follow the instruction at the footer of this advert.  To apply you will be a graduate, or of graduate calibre, with sales or telesales experience either as a parttime or holiday job or perhaps within a 'sandwich year'.  Please note that applicants cannot be considered if they do not have previous sales experience. To apply for the role you will be unfazed by cold calling and be competitive by nature. You will be intelligent, articulate and engaging with a natural ability to question to understand the needs of clients and possess the gravitas to earn the respect from all candidates and employer clients. You will be directly mentored on a oneonone basis by a highly experienced consultant and training after the induction period will be thorough and ongoing. After around a year all new consultants are encouraged to undertake formally recognised occupational psychology or recruitment qualifications. The fundamental reason for our success has been our positive and winning teamwork ethic and we are seeking an individual that embraces these values. We do not wish to hear from applicants whose hobbies are simply 'reading, listening to music or socialising with friends' and to apply we are looking for a person that has demonstrated throughout their life their desire to be 'above average'. Where you've excelled could be in any field  sport, charity work, an expedition to some farflung corner of the world, being chair of the debating society or performing on the West End stage, frankly it doesn't matter. What does matter though is that you must be an achiever with a 'zest for life' and a key part of the interview process will be based around your attitude, aspirations and determination to succeed. Whilst we're a fun and sales led business that enjoys a 'work hard, play hard' environment we do need credible individuals for these roles. We are in a professional business and our clients and candidates expect good personal presentation and an ability to build genuine rapport at often very senior levels. As the key to your success will be your positive attitude, hard work ethic and your desire to succeed there will be a tough and thorough recruitment process that includes personality questionnaires, ability testing and skills testing. To apply call our MD, Rob Scott or, if unavailable, Darren Dewrance, Stephen Minney or Giles Phillips on **** **** (8AM to 6PM) This job was originally posted as www.totaljobs.com/JobSeeking/GraduateTraineeRecruitmentConsultantMiltonKeynes_job****
