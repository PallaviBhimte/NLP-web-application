Hence its imperative that you have a thorough understanding of mechanical components. Make no mistake, this is a highly attractive proposition with a clear route to becoming a Technical Director within the company after a relatively short time. It would suit someone who comes from an organisation that doesnt have that big company mentality , without any of the stabilisers accustomed to such organisations. This lack of infrastructure shouldnt be viewed as a negative  someone who has an entrepreneurial spirit. Reed Specialist Recruitment Limited is an employment agency and employment business
