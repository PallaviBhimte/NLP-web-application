Description: We're looking for a talented and ambitious Account Director to join one of the fastest growing and most exciting consumer agencies in the UK. This creative Account Director will work on an exciting blend of accounts in the consumer lifestyle team. A portfolio will be tailored to suit the candidate's experience and objectives but will definitely be likely to include consumer tech clients, so consumer technology experience is desired. Experience in creating integrated campaigns; in particular campaigns spanning PR, digital and social media, experiential and retail would be an advantage. An ideal candidate would be someone who is tapped into cultural and consumer trends in the UK, EMEA and worldwide and who would use this insight to build exciting, engaging and creative campaigns. As mentioned previously, consumer technology experience is beneficial, however what is more important is being a consumer lifestyle brand expert who can deliver creative campaigns that tap into audience, media, product and cultural insights. The right candidate will have both UK and EMEA experience and as part of their role will have the opportunity to work on global campaigns. Strong strategic thinking, creativity and the ability to coach and lead a team are essential with a hunger for new business, the desire to do new and exciting work and the ambition to be part of the senior team of a rapidlygrowing business.
