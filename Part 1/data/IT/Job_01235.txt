Title: Refinery Planning Scheduling Optimisation Analyst
Webindex: 66773714
Company: Longbridge Recruitment  Limited
Description: Our client is an oil major based in London. For them we are hiring for an Optimisation Lead to take responsibility for short term optimisation of crude and product supply from the European refineries, to deliver a fully integrated approach to cross refinery operational planning and commercial trading for each product stream and market. The role is the interface between the Refinery Production Planners and the Traders, requiring a blend of refining, trading and analytic skills, and probably a specialism in a particular oil product, be it crude, light products, heavy oils etc. You will also coordinate the Weekly Price Forecast and the Inventory Management Program, for accurate forecasting and aligned hedge programmes. Close attention to program alignment and accuracy is required to ensure effective price management for each refinery operation. Whilst the role initially will relate to European refineries, it will extend to Transatlantic and Joint Venture European refinery operations. This is an exciting role as it initiates from engineering, but is a very commercial career, working directly alongside traders daybyday. For it you are likely either to be currently involved in refinery planning and scheduling, probably using Linear Programming LP tools, or will approach this from the Trading side, with your experience from another oil company (e.g. BP, Chevron, Conoco, Elf, Exxon, Mobil, Shell Statoil, Texaco, Total) or in a commercial environment, with a first degree in engineering, economics or business studies. Longbridge Technology is acting as an Employment Business with regard to this vacancy.
