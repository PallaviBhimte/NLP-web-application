Webindex: 68700929
Company: Interior Recruitment
Description: Our client, one of the countryâ€™s leading designers, manufacturers and suppliers of office partitioning and glazed products, is looking to recruit a Specification Sales Manager to cover the North West. This is a fantastic opportunity for a confident, outgoing, organised and dynamic sales manager to join this established business. Our client is looking for a dynamic individual, with previous experience of working within the commercial fitout industry, to take on a client facing role, looking after and developing relationships with a number of the major architectural practices in the North West. Knowledge, and previous experience of working with architects and designers producing project specifications is essential. As part of the role, you will also be expected to develop and manage new and existing dealer accounts, and will therefore have experience and a proven track record in account management. A good knowledge of office partitioning would be advantageous but not essential, as you may have been carrying out a similar role for manufacturers of other products within the commercial interiors sector. What is essential is to have good contacts and networks with the major architectural practices within the North West. The right candidate will need to work well as part of a very successful team, and will need to have the ability to report upstream on activity and progress. The successful candidate will need to be able to interact easily with clients, as this role will involve some entertaining and networking events. There is tremendous scope for the right individual to progress quickly within the company.
