Webindex: 69229954
Company: RE & M  Ltd
Description: Laser Development Engineer ? Fibre Lasers (Graduate to Senior level) Fibre Laser Engineers sought by a world leading supplier of Laser Physics technology. As a Physicist / Engineer you will be working on next generation High Power CW Laser Technologies to kW powers at Near Infrared wavelengths for materials processing applications at a company with a history of many decades of leadingedge Laser technology supply. Using your Physics, Optics and Fibre Optics skillsets you will be developing novel architectures, including looking at Laser Resonator Design / Development, geometries of Pumping schemes ? Diode Pumped, Diode to Fibre Pumped, Bar Diode, Free Space Optics design for Beam Propagation, Fibre / Pump launch, Fibre Coupling and Cladding issues ? double / triple clad. You will also be looking at Beam Delivery, undertaking beam analysis looking at issues such as beam quality, stability and efficiency, plus beam characterisation through methods such as M2 analysis. Working on Single Mode, Multimode and Large Mode Area Fibres your Fibre work will include Fibre Processing / Handling to optimise performance and manufacture including quality of endoffibre issues such as Fibre Attach methods and Back Reflection issues. Fused Components are critical part of the Fibre Laser architecture, so design integration of fused components such as Fused Combiners, Mode Field Adaptors and others will be a key part of your design and experimental work. You will also be looking at the manufacturability of the Fibre Lasers you will be developing. MSc / PhD in Physics or Optics with either a research or industrial background in Fibre Laser technology, including having just focused on this area or any of the technologies above at thesis level in your MSc / PhD. However, whether applying for a Senior or a Graduate level role you will need to be someone who enjoys undertaking experimental work undertaking practical / laboratory type work, rather than just simulation / modelling work. These are exciting opportunities to join a rapidly expanding team at a dynamic organisation with a strong market presence with products in high demand and a vision to be at the leading edge of High Power Fibre Laser technology.
