Title: Chef  food led pub restaurant near Guildford
Webindex: 67378792
Company: Brunning and Price
Description: The Refectory at Godalming was originally a cattle barn belonging to Milford House. It is extraordinary what you can make of a cattle barn: open fires and ancient wooden beams create a homely, cosy feel, whilst outside the extensive grounds and terrace garden are great for enjoying those rare days of sun. We’re looking for a Chef de Partie who will help set the highest standards of food quality and consistency. This is a busy working environment, and as well as having high standards and demonstrating good attention to detail, you’ll help the crew set the bar high in terms of cooking delicious dishes, maintaining effective kitchen controls and adhering to excellent standards of health and hygiene. Our menu has a spine of freshly prepared, classic British dishes, complemented by more exotic influences from other parts of the world: in other words, modern British cookery. Our passion lies in finding quality ingredients and preparing, cooking and presenting them in a modern but unpretentious way. The potential here is enormous and we’re looking for an ambitious and committed chef with a passion for good food who is ready to take the next step in their career. We provide all our chefs with real opportunities to develop with us into a senior chef role with training and support in place for you along the way. To explore the possibilities of joining our crew, email your CV and covering letter telling us a bit about yourself and what makes you tick to Katy at refectorybrunningandprice.co.uk This job was originally posted as www.caterer.com/JobSeeking/CheffoodledpubrestaurantnearGuildford_job****
