Company: Randstad
Description: Senior Quantity Surveyor required to join top 10 UK Developer I am currently resourcing for a Senior Quantity Surveyor to join a major, land and cash rich, top UK residential developer. The company undertakes projects in both London and the Southern Home Counties. The work within London is often on either New Build Brownfield Sites or is a complete refurbishment of a listed building. The New Build sites (in London) consist of RC frames, so to be considered for these schemes prior experience of these forms of construction is needed. The Schemes in the Southern Home Counties consist of high end, new build houses, **** **** **** and 5 bedroom houses, although can include refurbishments of historic buildings as part of the development. The ideal candidate will need to have experience of running schemes autonomously, sometimes multiple schemes concurrently, for a residential developer. The Client looks to see continued and sustained tenure at each employer, showing staying power and proving completion of projects. If your experience matches that required then please forward your CV for a confidential discussion. We welcome applications from candidates of all ages. Candidates must be eligible to live and work in the UK.
