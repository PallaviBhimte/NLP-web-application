Starting mainly on Larder and Garnish, the plan would be to become confident at running all of the kitchens sections within a relatively short time. I have an opportunity in a great fresh food gastro pub for a Chef De Partie where enthusiasm is key, and quality is to match. The food cooked here is exceedingly good, entirely fresh and the whole brigade from commis chef to chef de partie and Sous has a big part to play in the upkeep of the establishments' reputation.
