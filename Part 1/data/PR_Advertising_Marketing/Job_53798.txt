Description: Hello, UX/UI Designer  Media Content Provider  London  ****k  strong prototyping skills I am working with a client with a very unique offering, they are a NGO Content provider that are creating media platforms for oppressed communities. The company are based in central London and currently have a team of 9 in their UK office with plans to add a further **** this year. This role is the first dedicated user experience role within the business. You will be working very closely with the visual designer to help both UK and overseas clients unpack their ideas and ensure they are creating the right platform for their business. You should have experience of managing excitable stakeholders and be able to ensure their ideas are not only heard but also managed. There is a loose agile process in place which should take shape once a UK based Drupal developer is hired, therefore you will have somewhat of a carte blanche to implement your own style. The company have a research manager based in London so you will have the opportunity to work together, allowing you to understand the market place and help direct and lead the UCD process. The company have an open source development team that are located abroad, and have to date had issues ensuring their designs are correctly interpreted. This is the main bottle neck in their UX process, so HTML or Axure skills for creating clickable prototypes are ideal. You will then start to work in a truly iterative process with the designer and developer. If you are looking for a challenge to work with some very interesting clients then please get in touch.
