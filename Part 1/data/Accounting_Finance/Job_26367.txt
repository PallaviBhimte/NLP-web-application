Webindex: 69168435
Company: Huntswood Plc
Description: Could you work on a key project for a major retail bank here in Andover? There's full training, not to mention the chance to gain valuable work experience in the fastpaced world of financial services. Your focus will be on responding to customer queries both in writing and over the phone. There will be daily production targets but the work is not sales or cold calling. You'll need to be well organised and reliable with a keen eye for detail. The ability to use MS Word and Excel is important too. These roles will be starting in early February for an initial period of five months. You will work on a full time basis from Monday to Friday, from either 6am to 2pm or 2pm to 10pm. Some daytime shifts may be available. We'll be holding assessment centres in January and February at our head office in Reading.
