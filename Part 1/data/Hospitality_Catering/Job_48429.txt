Company: National Trust
Description: About the role Great food, great service, great people to work with. That’s catering at the National Trust. Working with the Catering Manager, you’ll be at the heart of our busy kitchen, helping to plan and execute menus that make the most of all the wonderful fresh, local, seasonal produce around you (70% of our kitchen ingredients are sourced by cooks and chefs themselves). You’ll serve up a treat every time, producing dishes to the highest standards, whether it’s tea and toast or a typical British roast dinner. You’ll also assist in the order, purchase and stock control of goods as well as maximise cost by making the most effective use of our local products. Yes, it can be hard work, with lots of customers to serve, but that’s the beauty of working in a great team: you’re never on your own. There’s always someone to turn to for support. We appreciate that you have a life outside of work too, so we don’t do split shifts or evening work. This means that as well as enjoying a rewarding job, you’ll have an altogether better worklife balance. About you Like everyone here, you love seeing empty plates and happy customers. With a city and guilds ****/**** and ****/**** qualification or equivalent catering experience, you already know your way around a busy kitchen. But you are more than just a cook, you are planner; capable of planning, preparing and organising seasonal menus within a budget and enjoy working as part of a team. You already hold a Basic Food Hygiene Certificate and if you have a First Aid certificate, that’s even better. Incredibly rewarding From amazing places to helpful colleagues to great benefits, we want work to be a pleasure. As well as giving you free admission to all our incredible places (that’s you and your family), you’ll enjoy a helpful 20% off at our shops, cafes and restaurants. There’s also MY Discounts, a brilliant scheme that gives you exclusive discounts with hundreds of retailers and big brands. But they’re just the benefits we can tell you about here. About us Here at the National Trust, we want even more people to enjoy our extraordinary places. We want people of all ages and backgrounds to get involved with them, be inspired by them, and love them as much as we do. That’s why we’ve put some bold ambitions in place.
