Description: This caring and friendly Church of England primary school in north Birmingham is looking for an experienced Level 3 qualified teaching assistant for a long term position staring as soon as possible.

You should have good previous experience of working with challenging behaviour but not necessarily within a Special Needs background, be patient and have a caring disposition. The school building is modern and has eight rooms designated as class bases. In addition they have **** community rooms; one designated as a base from which the Learning Mentors work and one which is mainly used as a base for 'school's Out' Club (before and after school facility). The Nursery class has its own selfcontained unit with its own playground, toilets and other amenities. The Reception class has a double size classroom as its base to enable the staff to have sufficient space to deliver the Foundation Stage curriculum. Outside there is a separate playground for the Nursery class. REQUIREMENTS The successful candidates will be confident and have a positive approach, as well as having relevant teaching qualifications, the right to work in the UK, 2 professional teaching references from within the last 2 years and a valid CRB.
