Description: Berkshire. This is a fantastic opportunity for a commercially experienced C.Net / ASP.Net developer to join a dynamic, expanding software house in the Financial services sector. The successful C.Net / ASP.Net developer will have 2 year commercial experience of developing software applications through the full software life cycle using C.Net, ASP.Net (Web forms) and XML with extensive experience of MS SQL Server 2005 onward as the back end database. My client has a state of the art product set that is used extensively in the Banking and Financial services industry and due to business growth requires an experienced C.Net / ASP.Net developer to develop new products in close conjunction with their clients. The successful C.Net / ASP.Net developer will have commercial experience of Agile / RAD development environments and enjoy working in small technical development teams. If the C.Net / ASP.Net developer has systems integration experience it would be a distinct advantage as there is a high demand for my clients software to be integrated into 3rd party providers software. If you are a strong VB.Net developer with some C.Net / ASP.Net / SQL Server development experience you will be considered.
