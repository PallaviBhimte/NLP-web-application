Title: Research Data Auditor (x****)
Webindex: 67772723
Company: University of Strathclyde
Description: The vision of the University of Strathclyde is bold and transformational, placing it among the leading international technological universities. Excellence in research is critical to this vision. Based initially in Research and Knowledge Exchange Services but working closely with colleagues in Library Services, you will deliver core aspects of the Research Data Management and Sharing project that will build on our current open access repositories for our research publications to enable the sharing of associated research data. You will be responsible for conducting a research data survey across all academic faculties, departments and schools in order to find out what research data we capture (size, formats e.g from videotapes to complex digital datasets), how academics and PGR students manage their research data during the life of a project and what needs to be in place to support the longer term storage and sharing of research data and associated research publications once a project ends. Primarily using online questionnaires and semistructured interviews to capture the information, you will then be expected to compile the results and develop a set of recommendations for the project. In addition to substantial relevant experience, you will have experience conducting surveys using a variety of tools, have good communication and critical questioning skills as well as the ability to develop clearly constructed arguments (written and verbal). This appointment is initially for 6 months with the potential for extension for a further one year to cover direct engagement with academic departments and schools during the delivery of key recommendations from the initial survey.
