This means a flexible and adaptable attitude is paramount, as you will learn from the bottom up. These outstanding career opportunities will suit highly motivated, money hungry graduates with plenty of enthusiasm and a keen desire to learn. A willingness to do even the most menial of tasks initially is important as well as a great team spirit. That said, applicants must be highly articulate and well presented, with a confident and personable disposition.
