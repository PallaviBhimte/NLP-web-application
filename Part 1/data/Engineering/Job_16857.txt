Webindex: 68705511
Company: England Associates
Description: Skilled Labourer's only apply My client is looking to take a steady stream of skilled labourer's initially starting in the Southampton area but will be moving through Hampshire towards the north. I am looking for labourers who may have a small selection of tools, possibly a vehicle and who can take on a job, make it their own whilst being responsible and trustworthy at the same time. The ideal candidate will have previous experience as a labourer but who has picked up some key skills along the way, even may have a few qualifications and can really turn their hand to almost anything. Obviously the rate you are paid will reflect on what skills you have so the more the better. The project will be starting towards the end of February so if you are currently working on a project that you are unsure of when or if it will be coming to an end then please get in touch.
