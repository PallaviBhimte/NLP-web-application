The agency needs a stellar Account Manager to join the team. You will be a consumer expert with a successful track record in the agency world to date.

The clients of this agency have come to expect intelligent PR and the team works on integrated strategies and operates at senior level. You will be a consummate team player and someone who is both a creative and an implementor. In return you will be rewarded for you time and efforts with a good basic salary and you will also find yourself working alongside a team of professionals who enjoy their work and share in their successes. Team get togethers are a regular part of work here from a quick drink after work in a bar to a BBQ on the terrace.
