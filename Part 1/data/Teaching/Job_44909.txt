Description: Sunderland School of Pharmacy and City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust ****  **** pa Up to and including 37 hours per week for nominal purposes. This post of Senior Lecturer in Pharmacy Practice and Clinical Therapeutics, which will be based at the University of Sunderland in Sunderland City Centre, is a progressive, innovative, partnership appointment between the Sunderland School of Pharmacy and, City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust. Established in 1921, the Sunderland School of Pharmacy is the second largest in the UK and, arguably, one of the most connected, not only via its premier regional position here in the North East of England, but also via its truly global Alumni, reflecting our 90 years of providing pharmacy education. We have a sustained track record of applied research with real world impact, which is both locally relevant, and internationally renowned. Carried out by multidisciplinary teams that span the fundamental and applied sciences, and which commonly include clinicians and other medical practitioners, this approach allows us to address the challenge of getting science into products and evidence into practice. Research into the development, testing and use of medicines features strongly in all of our research. Similarly, as a partner in Fuse ( www.fuse.ac.uk ), the Centre for Translational Research in Public Health, our emphasis is not only on putting evidence into practice, but also researching how best to do this. City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust has an exemplar leading edge service that has invested in modern pharmaceutical facilities, including electronic prescribing, automated dispensaries and, more importantly, extensive clinical pharmacy and fully integrated medicines management personnel to enhance the patient s experience of care by improving the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the service delivered. Our delivery record has enabled the Trust to support a number of additional practice developments involving advanced practice pharmacist roles, delivering direct specialist pharmaceutical care . This partnership appointment between the University and The NHS Foundation Trust (salaried at the University, with governance arrangements, including an Honorary Contract at City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust and, a research passport to support the activities), therefore seeks a highly motivated Registrant of the General Pharmaceutical Council, who has experience and an uptodate understanding of current trends in Pharmacy Practice and Clinical Therapeutics, and who can enhance the reputation of the Sunderland Pharmacy School and City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, through providing professional clinical and pharmaceutical input in an agreed specialist area and, to help develop the practice research agenda and learning and development opportunities, for mutual benefit.
