Company: Domestic and General Services Limited
Description: Web Project Managers  Wimbledon At Domestic and General our market position as the UK's leading warranty protection provider has been sustained despite the economic downturn. With a customer base in excess of 14 million, we have doubled our growth in the last 5 years. This growth has had a major impact on our Marketing Services Web team and as a result we have two new positions for Web Project Managers to develop and deliver on the web strategy roadmap for our international organisation. Responsible for all non IT aspects of our web initiatives, the Web Project Managers will coordinate planning and project management of both our clients' and our websites to include: content, user experience, design, translation (if international), user interface development, user acceptance testing and training. The analysis and construction of new project plans together with resource and task management will be key to the role. To be a great Web Project Manager, you will have substantial project management experience ideally within a web environment, however we may also consider applicants with substantial web experience but who want to develop their career in project management. Essentially you will be an effective communicator, be comfortable juggling and prioritising, be independent if needed and above all remain calm under pressure. Applications are welcome from degree calibre candidates, who are technically competent on MS Project/Project server, Microsoft Office, and have an understanding of HTML and CSS, and who can demonstrate commitment to a career in project management. Our benefits include a competitive salary, 25 days holiday, PPP and matched pension scheme plus discounts on electrical goods and warranty products.
