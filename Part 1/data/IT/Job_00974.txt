Webindex: 66377925
Description: I currently have a number of exciting opportunities in the credit modelling space and would be keen to speak to anyone who is interested in discussing a move into either a consultancy or a leading bank. I have a variety of roles at different levels within a number of prominent financial institutions. Candidates should have:  At least a masters degree (or equivalent qualification) in a quantitative discipline and the ability to contribute to a culture of continuous improvement.  Proven experience in PD, LGD, EAD models  regardless of the focus (retail, wholesale, corporate, investment banking, consulting)  Strong technical skills (SAS, SQL, R)  Strong communications skills with the ability to provide advice or push back on internal stakeholders.  Experience of building economic capital models will be considered an advantage.  Full rights to work in the UK (whether that be through citizenship or a working VISA) If you feel that this matches your profile, please get in touch as I have a number of things that could be of interest and will be happy to tailor my mandates to individual skill sets.
