Company: Gladstone Park Limited
Description: PASTRY DEMI OR CHEF DE PARTIE, required for a long standing client in central London. The Hotel is a privately owned **** star de luxe with a ****AA Rosette restaurant but the hotels outlets often cook to a higher standard as their many national and international awards give evidence to. So this is very much a real career opportunity for a progressing young chef. Having such high standards means that you will need the highest possible standards, possibly having worked at ****AA Rosette standard The hotel also has strong links to Buckingham Palace which is just round the corner and many of the wedding guests for the recent Royal wedding stayed here. There is a **** seater fine dining restaurant, four function rooms and a busy bar served by a **** strong brigade including this demi chef de partie sauce . The head chef is a natural leader and teacher and many chefs stay with him long term. The salary, set at **** TO **** is outstanding for a demi or chef de partie and the hotel expects only outstanding chefs who have a solid ****AA or ****AA Rosette background to apply. Please do not apply unless you have an absolute right to work in the UK, stay in the majority of your positions for at least one year and have at least two years experience at commis chef or demi chef pastry at a ****AA Rosette, or more, establishment in a four or five star hotel.
