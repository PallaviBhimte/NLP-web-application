Your role will be to be the development voice for the Client Services team, the clientside voice for the development team. You will be acting almost as a translator; breaking down complex technical requirements into bitesize information for the benefit of clients, and scaling up nontechnical requirements for the development team. The development environment is varied, with a mixture of Open Source technologies and .net. Whilst handson development experience is not key, a strong exposure and understanding is required in order to fulfil this position. A Digital Agency (or high volume software house) background is key as the projects come thick and fast and multiple simultaneous projects are not uncommon. This role is not outandout client facing, however there may be a need to visit client sites so business acumen and strong communication skills are a must. I'll be keen to discuss this position further on receipt of your CV.
