Description: Discover Your Future at Lincoln Exciting new appointments in the School of Engineering Reader The Lincoln School of Engineering was founded in **** with HEFCE Development Funding in collaboration with Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery and other employers in the engineering sector. It is the first new engineering school to be established in the UK for decades and has been extraordinarily successful: it was highlighted as a best practice case study in the Governmentcommissioned Wilson Review (exploring BusinessUniversity Collaboration) and awarded a Lord Stafford Award for groundbreaking collaboration between industry and academia. It was recently awarded the Times Higher award for Outstanding Employer Engagement, and the University is one of Siemens Principal Partner Universities. The School has quickly established itself as a centre of excellence for engineering education and research and it now wishes to expand its academic staff profile through new appointments at Lecturer, Senior Lecturer and Reader level. We are particularly keen to recruit staff with expertise in fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, rotordynamics and combustion, although applicants with related expertise should not be discouraged. We are looking for individuals who understand the importance of research and how it underpins academic endeavour, and who will also have an enthusiasm for contributing to the future success and expansion of the School of Engineering. Successful candidates will have a proven track record, or evidence of potential, for conducting worldclass research, including income generation and highquality publications.
