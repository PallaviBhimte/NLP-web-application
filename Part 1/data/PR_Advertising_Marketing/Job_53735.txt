Webindex: 68706844
Company: Form Recruitment
Description: One of the worldâ€™s best known property websites is seeking an Online / Digital Marketing Manager to join their highly capable marketing team in central London. As an Online / Digital Marketing Manager, you will work alongside two other marketing managers (who also have online / digital marketing experience) to deliver highly targeted and innovative online / digital marketing campaigns. Whilst this is a heavily online / digital marketing focussed position, it's important to note that campaigns will often be owned across channels, so some background and ability in traditional marketing methods will be required. Over the years, this organisation has all but conquered the online property advertising marketplace and continue to dominate in this competitive area. They are very established, well structured and extremely profitable, allowing you to expand your knowledge within a stable but dynamic environment. You could easily describe them as a household name and this means your work will be seen by a very large percentage of your friends and family. In order to be considered, you should be able to demonstrate substantial experience in all of the following:  Developing, managing and executing online / digital marketing strategies within a large organisation.  Identifying growth opportunities and planning online / digital marketing campaigns to achieve business objectives.  Presenting online / digital marketing campaign concepts and performance analysis at senior management meetings.  Working with large sales teams to understand their needs and help identify growth opportunities.  Managing external design agencies to deliver your concept. Ideally, this experience will have been gained within an online organisation. However, candidates from other industries will be considered if they have all of the requirements and are from an established organisation. If you think this might be the one for you, send your CV now and we will be in touch to run through things in more detail.
