Description: We are working with a private engineering and training firm in the South Staffordshire area who are looking for a Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM) Analyst to join the company s growing RCM team on a permanent, fulltime basis. The RCM team are currently doing a lot of work on military equipment in maritime and aviation, and are looking to take someone on with previous RCM analysis experience. They are currently looking to expand the maritime side of their operation, so they are looking to recruit someone with maritime or naval RCM experience. Most of the work will take place on the main site in South Staffordshire, but there would be occasional work in other places, so the candidate would be expected to have a full driving licence and their own form of transport. The salary will be between **** and **** per annum (depending on qualifications and experience), and will also include a 5% supplementary pension, private health care, an optional share scheme, an annual bonus (which depends upon their individual performance and the success of the company as a whole) and 26 days paid holiday (plus statutory days such as bank holidays). The role will be five days a week, working **** hours. If additional work is needed to complete the task, the candidate will be expected to put some extra hours in, but the company operates on an informal flexitime policy at the managers discretion. The candidate MUST come from a maintenance engineering or preventative maintenance background, and be familiar with either RCM or MSG**** (Maintenance Steering Group ****). Candidates should also have experience of conditionbased maintenance and condition monitoring, and be aware of and understand FMECA (Failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis). Ideally, the company are looking for exmilitary junior NCOs for maintenance engineering, but this is not an absolute requirement. I am looking to set up interviews as soon as possible, so if you are interested and available for interview, please reply with your CV and daytime contact number and I ll get back to you. Please feel free to pass on my details if you know someone who might be interested
