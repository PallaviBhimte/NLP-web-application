Webindex: 68712732
Company: Espire Selection
Description: Premier Education in conjuction with Espire are looking for primary teachers to work in primary schools in the Halifax and Huddersfield area either doing day to day or long term supply work. You must be passionate about working with children and committed to achieving high standards in all aspects of your work. Applications are particularly welcome from Early Years Specialists and teachers with experience of working with EAL pupils. Interviews will be held locally in Halifax or Huddersfield. Premier Education has been a leading Education agency in the North West since **** If you are interested in working with us, our Director Alistair McCrone who has helped a large number of teachers find permanent work through the supply route will be helping you find work. Testimonial Oct**** Premier Education is definitely the best supply agency I've worked for as a Primary NQT. Alistair and his team’s approach is friendly and personal. The Premier team are supportive, helpful and show an interest in how your supply work is going by keeping in touch regularly. I have found that Premier Education takes the time to build up positive relationships with their supply staff and with their schools. I have gained lots of positive experience in schools as a NQT and found that by following Premier’s advice I was asked back to schools. I am currently completing my NQT year in a school where I had done regular supply work; Alistair recommended me for long term supply work in this school and this has resulted in a job there. I would highly recommend Premier Education for NQTs and any other teachers looking for supply work in this area. If I return to supply work in the future, I would have no hesitation in working with them again.
