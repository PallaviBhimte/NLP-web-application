Title: IT RECRUITMENT CONSULTANT  EC****
Webindex: 70457534
Company: The Sales Recruitment Network
Description: IT RECRUITMENT CONSULTANT My client who is a very successful IT Recruitment Consultant with offices in the Home Counties London and throughout the world is looking for experienced recruitment consultants seeking a challenging, demanding but very rewarding career in IT Recruitment . The successful applicants must have excellent people skills, be able to listen to define clients needs and act upon their needs. The company has an excellent training programme in place and there are plenty of opportunities for speedy advancement within the company for the talented. There is no reason why an experienced consultant cannot become a team leader within six months of joining the organisation. A good understanding of the IT industry is essential but the company is also looking for people who are ambitious and target driven and strive to achieve; they will therefore consider applicants who have had a career in IT previously but not as a recruitment consultant, alternatively, they will also consider applicants who have a proven track record in Recruitment but not necessarily specialised in IT. Like many opportunities the basic salary is supported by an excellent commission package; ideally the person will be making the statement within six months that they have a fantastic commission package supported by a basic salary; as the revenue is uncapped and very much depends on how ambitious and professional the individual is; the top consultants are already achieving a six figure salary. If you feel you “work to live” and want the best in life, this company will give you all the tools required to achieve your goals and dreams.
