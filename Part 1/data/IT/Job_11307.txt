Description: Mid Level ASP.Net/C Developer  Commutable from Bristol, Bath, Chippenham, Trowbridge, Thornbury  ****K****K I am seeking an ASP.Net/C Web Developer to work for a well known client in the Bristol area. Working in a small development team, you will have full lifecycle responsibility for a range of fast paced projects using the latest Microsoft technologies. The successful candidate will have demonstrable commercial experience of working in a .Net development role. The projects you will be working on will be small and module based, and you will work on them from start to finish. You will have the opportunity to work with the latest Microsoft technologies (eg ASP.MVC, ASP.Net/C ****), and this really does represent a great opportunity for a junior/midlevel Developer to learn and develop their skills in a fastpaced and extremely busy environment. You will be required to use both front and back end development skills, so you must have some experience of SQL Server and C or VB.Net development as well as strong front end skills. People from either a C or VB.Net development background will be considered. The right person for this role will be a fast learner, who is comfortable in working on their own and as part of a small development team. This is a supportive environment where you will have the opportunity to learn from the more senior developers, and full training plans are offered and agreed with all development staff. Because this is a small team, any good ideas that you have to offer in terms of suggesting new technologies and approaches will be considered, so you will have a real and genuine say in the direction of the development team moving forward. This vacancy is urgent, so please apply without delay Keywords: ASP.Net, ASP.MVC, C, HTML5, JQuery, Javascript, CSS, VB.Net, SSRS, XAML, Winforms, SQL Server, Visual Studio This job was originally posted as www.cwjobs.co.uk/JobSeeking/MidlevelASPNetC%****WebDeveloper_job****
