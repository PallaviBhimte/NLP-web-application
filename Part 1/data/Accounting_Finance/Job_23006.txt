Webindex: 66553113
Company: Goodman Masson
Description: The team is responsible defining the bank's European strategy in a number of areas. The team sits at group level and is responsible for a number of areas but there is a particular focus on retail banking so a keen interest in this area would be a plus. The successful candidate is likely to currently work at top tier strategy house e.g. Bain, McKinsey, Oliver Wyman, BCG or Booz and ideally will have gained experience on financial services projects. Those who have worked on nonFS projects but would like to make the move across may also be considered. Top tier academics are a must.
