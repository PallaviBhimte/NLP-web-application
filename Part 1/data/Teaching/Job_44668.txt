Title: EPSRC PhD Studentship:
Webindex: 68023202
Company: The University of Manchester
Description: Start date: ASAP hopefully before March 15th Closing date for applications: March 15th Project details: This PhD study will focus on swirling and mixing of hot and cold fluids in bends and T junctions to study effects of thermal wallspots topology and their penetration into the steel walls possibly inducing thermal stress fatigue and structural damage. Standard engineering practices are based on segregated solid/fluid simulations, so, findings will be reformatted in terms of fluctuating wall heat transfer coefficients for use in applied simulations at high Reynolds numbers. The researcher will extend Manchester s Synthetic Eddy generator, developed for upstream Reynolds Averaged  downstream Large Eddy Simulations, and create a realistic synthetic wallhotspot generator for fluctuating stresses in pipes and vessel walls structural simulations. Detailed Direct Numerical Simulation Data for this purpose will be generated by coworkers as part of a larger overarching project. The student will also contribute to trustworthy and detailed databases for refined validation of simulation software: running test cases and benchmarking workshops for enhancing reliability of CFD in thermal hydraulics safety studies. Sponsor: ROLLSROYCE Qualifications: The project is fully funded (tuition fees and student stipend) and applicants with (or expecting to receive) a 1st or upper 2nd class UG/Master Engineering or Physical Sciences degree, with a fluid mechanics and computer simulations background, are sought. Funding: A bursary of **** per annum tax free is provided to the successful candidate. The project is focused on upstream fluid mechanics research but funded by leading industries in naval propulsion and power generation from nuclear fuels. Visits at sponsor s premises, accessing documentation on geometry etc. and will require clearance eligibility. Offers of a nuclearplant thermofluids simulation expert career following the PhD are also likely. Apply only if you are confident you are eligible. For guidance, please check your suitability at the following web site http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/students/Pages/eligibility.aspx . The studentship covers Home tuition fees and a stipend of ******** depending on PhD format and previous experience. Due to company restrictions the post is available to UK applicants only as the successful candidate needs to be able to obtain security clearance.
