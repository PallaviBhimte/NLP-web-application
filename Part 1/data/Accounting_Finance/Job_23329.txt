Description: My client, a FTSE 250 sized property firm based in Central London, are looking to recruit an accounts payable clerk to join their busy team on a permanent basis. Working in a medium sized team, this position looks after invoice processing for one of the core business units of the company. It deals with all their incoming credit note / invoices on a daily basis, reconciling supplier statements and ensuring payments are made to suppliers, processing refunds and liaising with internal and external clients on any issues that arise. The ideal candidate for this position would have 2 years of full accounts payable experience within a fairly large business, have used JD Edwards (or a similar accounting IT system such as SAP, Oracle, Sun etc) and be a good communicator and team player. The business requires someone to join the team asap so a weeks notice period, or less, would be a definite advantage.
