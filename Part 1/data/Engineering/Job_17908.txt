The main purpose of this role is to support and enable the project team to successfully commission, handover and closedown projects at minimal compliance risk, ensuring projects are delivered on time and to budget.

Alongside this are well planned and executed commissioning and management of project closedown activities through to final acceptance. The postholder will have a knowledge and understanding of processes used in Water Wastewater Treatment, or have a proven ability to commission complex technical solutions, as part of a multidisciplinary team. It is expected that the postholder will have sound experience in order to recognise and minimise the risks associated with commissioning of Capital Investment projects.
