Description: Our client is one of the UK s leading regional insurance brokers and independent financial advisors in East Anglia, and expanding their trading area further afield outside of Norfolk and Suffolk. We are currently looking to recruit ambitious talented individuals who can operate as Commercial Client Managers or Account Executives, where they will be given autonomy to provide expert independent advice and head a team of like minded individuals. This is an opportunity to work without restraints but have the support and specialism of a larger broker when required. This could appeal to an Account Executive working in a new business capacity, or perhaps an owner of a Commercial Brokerage who is keen to join a leading player, with a like minded approach to client relationships. Candidates will need to be confident communicators with enthusiasm and ambition. They can continue to work in their location to provide their clients with expert independent advice and, with support from an established company, be able to grow new and existing business. You will be dedicated to providing a professional service and achieve a high level of business by building on your relationships with clients in your area. You would be provided with a well resourced support team including compliance. To recognise and reward your contribution there are above average remuneration packages which are flexible enough to motivate the most talented.
