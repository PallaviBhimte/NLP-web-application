SCONUL promotes awareness of the role of academic libraries in supporting research excellence and student achievement and employability, and represents their views and interests to government, regulators and other stakeholders. It helps academic libraries collaborate to deliver services efficiently, including through shared services, and to share knowledge and best practice. SCONUL members are the academic libraries themselves, with the heads of library service making up the Executive Board which is responsible for governance and for setting the strategy for the organisation. SCONUL also has four Strategy Groups which are responsible for ensuring that the academic library community is informed about, and engaged with, the major issues and challenges facing the library sector. They are supported by an Executive Director and office, engaged in policy development, lobbying and coordination and support. The Head of Policy and Member Engagement is a new position which will ensure that members are provided with an excellent service through effectively gathering and delivering intelligence regarding developments in academic libraries, contributing to and providing support to various strategic groups, and developing the agenda for SCONUL’s executive board.
