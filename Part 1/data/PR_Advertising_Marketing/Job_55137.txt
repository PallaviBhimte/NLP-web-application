Webindex: 71844478
Company: BENTLEY ASSOCIATES
Description: If you are looking for a role with variety and where no 2 days are the same, then read on. The MD of this well renowned and successful PR agency needs a PA to support her in her personal and business life. You will look after her everchanging diary, coordinate her meetings, organise travel arrangements and generally preempt her every move. You are the sole administrator in the office and so will also take on office management responsibilities as well. The ideal candidate will have accrued some senior level experience already and will be used to liaising at all levels. You should have an interest in PR although this is not for someone who wants to move into account executive work. This is a purely administrative position and will suit someone with a calm demeanour who loves a creative environment and enjoys the challenges and variety that looking after a very successful and hugely busy senior executive entails. We regret that we cannot reply to all applications. If you do not hear from us within **** working days, please understand that, on this occasion, your CV has not been selected for our client.
