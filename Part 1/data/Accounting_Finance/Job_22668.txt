Do you want to understand what makes technology companies tick? Do you want to meet lots of influential and interesting founders and tech investors? Then come work with us for a crash course in tech entrepreneurship. But beware: you might never want to leave  Us: We a rapidly growing company whose mission is to help UK technology companies to get funding without giving up equity, primarily via R D Tax Credits and Grants. How rapidly growing? After a very profitable first year and a second year that was 4 times more so, we are on track to turn over more than 1m in the third year. If you want to help us make this happen, read on.  The position: We are looking for an enthusiastic, determined, driven new team member to help us with contacting new potential clients (some of the UK's most innovative startups and tech companies), building strong relationships with them, finding winwin deals that will benefit both the client, us, and, of course, closing sales. This is only the base set of responsibilities. We are still a small company, so there are plenty of other things to do (and everyone does a bit of everything). In addition to your day job (in this case, sales), you will be expected to do other, related projectbased work, for which you will be rewarded with regular, quarterly pay raises. We are looking for a very keen salesperson who wants to get a great start in the startup world. There are very few careers that will give you this level of insight into such a variety of tech companies, as well as build so many relations across with interesting and successful people. Apart from this you will also get to work directly with our founders, which will provide many opportunities to learn about startups, technology, sales and entrepreneurship. This is a truly excellent opportunity if you want a crash course in entrepreneurship and to build a great personal network of company founders and investors.  You: This is not a job for everybody. You must be flexible, pragmatic, have tons of energy and enthusiasm, love talking to people, with excellent written and spoken communication skills. You need to have a dedicated approach to following up over a long period of time, and be willing to try and figure out ways to help prospects even when a sale is unlikely. Startups are a small world and having the right attitude is crucial to help us build and maintain our great reputation. Our sales process is well defined, and generally short. You must be willing to pursue leads for as long as it takes sometimes days, sometimes weeks and even months. You need to be the kind of person who cares and wants to be passionate about their job. Please note that this doesn t mean that we ll work you to the bone. On the contrary, we believe in working healthy and productive hours. The best work is done by people who are happy, healthy and wellrested, and we want the best work. In terms of experience, we will only consider people with some product sales experience for this position. We unfortunately cannot afford to train someone from scratch on the possibility that they might be good at sales. Only apply if you feel you can make a case for why you'd be able to sell our products.  How to apply As this is a sales role, which will involve written, phone and inperson communication, the hiring process will match this. Please start by appying with a CV and a brief clear cover letter outlining why you wish to work with us, what you hope to achieve, what you expect from the role, and why you're the best person to fit our team. Application Statement: By applying for this role you give express consent for us to process submit (subject to required skills) your application to our client in conjunction with this vacancy only.
