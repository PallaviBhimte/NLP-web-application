Webindex: 70520282
Company: Oliver James Associates
Description: One of London s leading names seeks to recruit two actuarial students to join its impressive teams. These roles are without doubt the most appealing roles available on the London market because you will get exposure to every actuarial duty (pricing, reserving, capital modelling, Solvency II, planning, rate monitoring and reinsurance treaty work) whilst you will work alongside many different skill sets (actuaries, accountants, underwriters and operations). Any general insurance background will suffice, but you must be eligible to work in the UK and have very strong communication skills.
