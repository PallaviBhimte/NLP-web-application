Title: Research Assistant in Medical Statistics
Webindex: 66700458
Company: University of Cambridge
Description: Salary: ******** pa The posted is funded for 2 years in the first instance, with likely extension thereafter. The successful candidate will work on the analysis of a prospective cohort study which has completed recruitment (July 20****2) and will have completed all data collection by Spring 201****. A total of **** women with first pregnancies have been recruited. They have been serially scanned from their first antenatal visit (12 weeks) with research scans performed at **** **** and ****6 weeks gestational age. Blood samples have been obtained at the same intervals. The final dataset will consist of maternal demographic characteristics, data from the serial ultrasound scans (fetal measurements and placental blood flow measures), combined with an extensive series of biomarkers. The major outcomes of interest are intrauterine growth restriction and preeclampsia (i.e. pregnancy induced high blood pressure and renal dysfunction). The data represent a unique international resource and it is anticipated that a series of high profile publications will arise, with significant impact on maternity care. The post will involve an element of data cleaning and record linkage. But the primary role will be to perform analysis of the dataset. Major analytic methods will include multivariate linear and logistic regression, area under the ROC curve analysis, plus application of methods for adjusting for optimism (bootstrapping or cross validation). An appropriate qualification in Statistics is essential. A PhD and/or previous experience of multivariate analysis of observational data is desirable. The cohort has been funded by the Women's Health theme of the NIHR Cambridge Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre. The study protocol has been published: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC****/ The PI of the study is Prof Gordon Smith of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. There is a strong track record of publication of obstetric epidemiological research in top journals over the last 10 years, with original research publications in Nature (1), NEJM (2), JAMA (3), Lancet (2), BMJ (****) and PLoS Medicine (3). The post will be based in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. However, there are very close links with the nearby MRC Biostatistics Unit and the Department of Public Health. Supervision will be performed jointly with two biostatisticians: Dr Ian White (Programme Leader MRC BSU) and Dr Angela Wood (Lecturer, IPH).
