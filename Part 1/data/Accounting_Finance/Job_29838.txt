This team has an impressive track record of successful deal origination/selection and now seeks a strong business developer to further help source investment opportunities. Alongside senior financiers, you will be expected to source offmarket opportunities by building long term relationships directly with potential investee companies and also with potential introducers to such businesses including corporate financiers, bankers and accountants. You will demonstrate excellent communication skills with an ability to attain buyin quickly from senior stakeholders (typically CFO and CEO level).
