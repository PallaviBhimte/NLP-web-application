Webindex: 67101727
Company: Cherry Professional Limited
Description: Our retained client is an entrepreneurial and growing business that operates across a number of sectors. The organisation has recently won a number of new contracts and as such has a requirement to recruit. Reporting to the Head of Finance you will have day to day finance responsibility for a site including full management information and analysis. Working closely with the business the role is very commercially focused and includes budgeting, forecasting, costing and pricing decisions. The management team is extremely strong and in this expanding business there is a high probability of future career progression. As a professional recruiter I have recruited for this organisation for a number of years and all of the candidates I have placed have progressed their careers and gained valuable experience. The successful candidate will have the confidence to take responsibility for a site, be able to deal with operational staff at all levels and hold a recognised professional accounting qualification (ACA, ACCA, ACMA). Given the Christmas break I will be reviewing CVs between Christmas and New Year and in early January.
