Webindex: 46633185
Description: Just Social Care urgently requires experienced support workers to work within residential adults homes supporting adults. The care homes are based in and around Guildford, Surrey. A flexible working pattern is available with the majority of the hours being undertaken during the weekend; however the potential for full time hours will be made available for all workers who demonstrate a strong flexible working ethos and commitment to the role. It is our intention to provide a team of same named workers who are able to commit on going to the care home to ensure continuity for the service users they support. If you have demonstrable relevant experience working as a senior support worker and access to all or some of the above areas and can provide the commitment we require, we look forward to hearing from you.
