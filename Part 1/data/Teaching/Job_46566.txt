Company: REDACTIVE PUBLISHING LTD
Description: The Marketer is the marketing industry’s leading magazine by circulation, published by Redactive Media Group on behalf of The Chartered Institute of Marketing. We’re looking for a journalist to assist with ecampaigns, help manage web content and to provide administrative support for the editorial team, as well as contributing to digital and print content. This would suit an NCTJqualified graduate who’s eager for their first role in publishing. You’ll be keen to get to grips with new software, highly organised and accurate, with superb attention to detail and excellent interpersonal skills – you’ll be someone who enjoys working both independently and as part of a small team. Any experience of working with a client will be an advantage. There will be opportunities for further development within the editorial team for the right candidate. This is not a marketing role. Redactive is the UK’s largest independent publisher working in partnership with membership organisations. To produce the best quality magazines, we aim to attract a diverse mix of people who have fresh, creative and challenging ideas. As well as a competitive salary, the benefits package includes a contributory pension scheme, excellent training opportunities and a personal training plan, 25 days’ holiday per year and subsidised gym membership. Based in bright, modern offices in Clerkenwell, the company culture is friendly, informal and creative, but with an emphasis on high quality work.
