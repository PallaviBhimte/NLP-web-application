Description: Maths Teacher: A fantastic high achieving school located in the heart of central London is looking to appoint a maths teacher from as soon as possible on a full time, permanent basis. The school performs well in terms of academic achievement (over 90% AC grades at GCSE last year) and pupil behaviour at the school tends to be excellent. The school consistently receives 'outstanding' Ofsted reports and the maths department is well facilitated and the Head of maths is experienced, approachable and supportive. The successful maths teacher will be expected to teach maths at KS**** to GCSE standard. An ALevel maths timetable may be available to a suitably qualified and experienced maths teacher but teaching to ALevel standard is not a requirement for applying to this role. The school is happy to accept applications from newly qualified maths teachers as well as from maths teachers with more experience. Overseas trained maths teachers are also welcome to apply. All maths teacher applicants should have Qualified Teachers Status or the NARIC recognised equivalent. To express an interest in this opportunity and for more information, please forward an updated CV to Gavin as soon as possible.
