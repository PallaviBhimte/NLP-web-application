Webindex: 64802202
Company: ABC Teachers
Description: A Primary School in NewcastleunderLyme who are currently in special measures are looking to recruit an experienced Year 5 teacher to start work immediately. The School are in the process of change and are looking to raise standards across the Key Stages. The School had a new head teacher in September who is looking to build a team of teachers to help turn the School around. They have made very good progress since the start of the academic year but now require an experienced Key Stage **** (KS****) teacher to cover the Year 5 class. Initially, the post will run for **** term however, this may run until the end of the academic year. The children are generally well behaved with one or two 'lively' pupils in the class so good behaviour management strategies will be essential. You will have a class size of **** pupils and a TA. In being successful you must be ready for a challenge. You are confident in your teaching ability and adaptable enough to effectively teach a class of very mixed abilities. If you think you have what it takes to give the pupils at this School the education they deserve we would love to hear from you so please get in touch.
