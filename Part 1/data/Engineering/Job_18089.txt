Our client, based in Bedford, is looking to hire **** skilled mechanical installation engineers to assist them with a number of site installations over the next few months. Based out of Bedford, you will report to their workshop each morning at 7am then travel out to the relevant sites to complete the installations. A current / valid CSCS card is essential, as is previous experience in site based mechanical installation of machinery and/or equipment. Their products are predominantly water processing equipment, so any previous exposure to the water industry or any previous water hygiene training would be advantageous, however neither are essential as training will be provided for the right individual. There is the possibility of the contract being extended beyond the 3 month marker and in fact the potential for the right person to become a permanent member of staff if that is of interest to them. However my client is quite happy to consider individuals only interested from a temporary contract point of view. To apply, please forward your CV to the email address provided.
