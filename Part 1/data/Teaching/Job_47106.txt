A Nursery and three Reception classes form the Early Years Foundation Stage provision. The school serves a diverse community where a large proportion of pupils are from minority ethnic backgrounds with about half at the early stages of learning English as a new language. A lowerthanaverage number of pupils has learning difficulties and/or disabilities, including those with statements of special educational needs. Their needs relate mainly to learning, behaviour, and speech and language difficulties. Additionally, the school has a resourced base class for eight pupils with specific learning difficulties from across the local authority. A high number of pupils join or leave the school at different times throughout the year, including some from refugee and asylumseeking families. Every child matters in this school and this focus is central to all that the school does. The excellent leadership of the Head Teacher ensures that all pupils make good progress and that their personal development is outstanding. The 5th year of the Every Child a Writer (ECaW) programme began successfully in September 2011. It aims to raise the attainment of all Year **** and **** pupils while securing two levels of progress across Key Stage 2. It draws on the support of leading literacy teachers to improve the provision of Quality First teaching, guided writing and onetoone tuition in Year **** and **** classrooms. The Head Teacher is losing her current EcaW Teacher due to a promotion within the school. She recognises that this scheme is the key to the success of Key Stage 2 pupils within her school.
